    "Welcome to Week 2 of the course!  We covered a lot of content last week in order to get to the point where we can search over our data.  In this notebook, you'll have the chance to improve your baseline retrieval scores by combining the strengths of keyword and vector search using Weaviate's `hybrid_search` method.  We'll also incorporate the use of a CrossEncoder reranker to pack the final punch in our retrieved hits, before we pass those results to the LLM for answer synthesis.  Here's a reminder of where we've been and where we're going:\n",

    "Hybrid search does just what it sounds like: it combines a keyword search with a vector search, which has the effect of combining the strengths of each method for improved retrieval.  If you'll recall, the initial vector retrieval results we saw with our out-of-the-box `miniLM` model were about 20 percentage points lower compared to the keyword results. My initial results with the `chunk_size` 256 dataset were `kw_hit_rate` of `.90` and a `vector_hit_rate` of a relatively lackluster `.71`: \n",

    "You may also have noticed that the `total_misses` score was `8`, meaning that neither method picked up the golden `doc_id` in the \"n\" retrieved results, a total of 8 times.  From another perspective, it means that between keyword and vector search, they found 92 out of 100 of the golden `doc_ids`.  So if 92 docs were found then how come we don't see a hit rate score of 92 in one of the two methods....?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you compare the total misses with the keyword hit rate (the highest scoring method), you'll see that keyword picked up 90 of the correct docs, but the combined results picked up 92.  We can interpret this to mean that the vector search method accounts for the difference of 2 hits between the keyword hit rate and the total of 92 correct documents found.  Combining these two search methods through hybrid search allows us to close this gap. \n",

Combining keyword and vector search scores is an area of active research, so the algorithm used by Weaviate is \"a\" way to perform hybrid search, not \"the\" way.  \n",

    "1. Execute a keyword and a vector search and get the raw scores and doc_ids of each.\n",
    "2. Normalize scores between 0 and 1 relative to each method.\n",
    "3. Multiply the normalized scores by a weighted value: `alpha`.\n",
    "4. Add scores together that both have the same `doc_id`.\n",
    "5. Combine search results together in ranked order according to score values. "

Working memory is the ability to hold and manipulate information over short periods and is closely linked to attention. Huberman discusses the role of dopamine in working memory, noting that both low and high levels can affect performance differently. He also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia in working memory and attention. Huberman suggests non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) or yoga nidra and deliberate cold exposure as behavioral methods to potentially increase dopamine levels and enhance working memory, with the caveat that more dopamine is not always beneficial, especially for those who already have high working memory capacity.',\n",

If you haven't already subscribed to our monthly Neural Network Newsletter, the Neural Network Newsletter is a completely zero-cost newsletter that provides podcast summaries and protocols in the form of brief PDFs of one to three pages in which I detail things like how to do deliberate cold exposure and some of the science behind it, how to regulate your dopamine levels, how to improve your sleep, and on and on.\",\n",

       "  'summary': 'In the \"Huberman Lab\" podcast episode titled \"Tools to Enhance Working Memory & Attention,\" Andrew Huberman explores the concept of working memory, its biological underpinnings, and strategies to improve it. Working memory is the ability to hold and manipulate information over short periods and is closely linked to attention. Huberman discusses the role of dopamine in working memory, noting that both low and high levels can affect performance differently. He also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia in working memory and attention. Huberman suggests non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) or yoga nidra and deliberate cold exposure as behavioral methods to potentially increase dopamine levels and enhance working memory, with the caveat that more dopamine is not always beneficial, especially for those who already have high working memory capacity.',\n",

    "# Reranking with CrossEncoders\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring to the system architecture diagram above, we'll now address the [2nd Stage Reranking phase](https://uplimit.com/course/rag-applications/v2/enrollment/enrollment_clt3drnnk00xo127l4b7ygurh/module/module_clt3drq5m007b16lf3eyg4741).  During this step we'll take the pool of candidate hits collected from the broad \"cast of the net\" from the 1st Stage Retrieval embedding model and narrow them down to a (hopefully) highly relevant set of results, before passing them to the LLM model for answer synthesis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to slightly transition away from the way we've been thinking about Retrieval up until this point.  Until now we've been focusing on improving our retrieval results by getting as many document \"hits\" as possible while keeping our `limit` value as low as possible.  We could easily improve our `hit_rate` by increasing the size of our net i.e. increase the `limit` value from 5 to 25 or more.  But, we're in the quality business, and we want to ensure that we are only passing high quality context to the LLM model, for three primary reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We care about the quality of the answers of the LLM.  LLM answer quality is direcly correlated with context quality.\n",
    "2. Tokens cost money.  The more tokens, the higher the cost.  Why send ten quality results when only 5, or maybe 3, will get the job done?\n",
    "3. LLM max context input length.  This is less of a concern than the first two reasons; however, depending on your use case and the size of the context you are feeding the LLM this may become a limiting factor.  If it does, you want to ensure that you are using your context window to it's highest potential i.e. not filling it with garbage search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the game, therefore, now becomes how big can we make our net (`limit` value) without making it too big that it starts to negatively impact the latency for returned results.  So instead of setting the initial `limit` value to 5, we'll cast a bigger net and set it to 150-200 and then use the CrossEncoder to narrow those results down to 5 (or 3 depending on what our goal is).  We'll take advantage of the CrossEncoder's powerful semantic similarity scoring between sentence pairs and use it to rerank our results, while keeping in mind the computational expense.  Let's see how this works in practice.  "

It's the same thing with nicotine cessation, it's the same thing with hormone optimization. If you do it as a household unit, it's far more helpful. So after stress, you have sleep optimization. Sleep is extremely important, especially for mitochondrial health as well. And then you have sunlight, which encompasses anything that's outdoors. So you move more, you have cold exposure, you have heat exposure, that's sunlight. And then last one is spirit. So that's kind of the body, mind, and soul.

They're mentalizing, right? They're thinking about each other's emotional states and they're coming at each other through agency and gratitude. Like, I'm so grateful for you. The example is these people are partners and they're happy with their partnership. Like, oh my God, I'm so grateful I found you. They would each feel that way. I'm so grateful you're in my life.

The other thing that a gratitude practice does is it's been shown to benefit social relationships, but not just for the relationship in which you express gratitude, right? So on the face of it, you might think, okay, if I express gratitude for somebody over and over, over and over, over and over, then I'm going to feel better about that person. And indeed that is one effect of a gratitude practice that's called a pro-social or inter-social gratitude practice. But there are now several studies, recent studies in good journals pointing to the fact that a regular gratitude practice can also enhance one's social relationships across the board, in the workplace, at school, with family, in romantic relationships, and even one's relationship to themselves, which is really what the subjective feelings of wellbeing are. So it's clear to me that an effective gratitude practice has an outsized effect on many, many aspects of mental and physical health.\",\n",

How is it that you can create that sense of receiving gratitude for yourself and thereby derive the effects of gratitude as outlined in this particular study? And there we go back to the important work of the great Antonio Damasio, who explored these neural correlates of gratitude to define the areas of the brain that are associated with pro-social behaviors like the prefrontal cortex. And what's really interesting about the work that Damasio and colleagues did is, first of all, they used functional magnetic resonance imaging. So this is a very high resolution approach to exploring what areas of the brain are active.

When there's a reciprocity, when the person receiving understands something about the person that's giving to them and understands that the person is giving genuinely, for instance. So there's an environmental interaction. It's not just about receiving, it's receiving from somebody that you know genuinely wants to give. And likewise for the giver in that equation, the feelings of wellbeing are far greater when the person receiving whatever it is, money, food, assistance in some form or another, it could be physical assistance, et cetera. When the giver has knowledge that the person receiving it genuinely needed the thing that they are receiving.

The basic takeaway of that episode is that it turns out receiving gratitude is a more powerful stimulus for the release of neurochemicals and activation of brain areas associated with so-called pro-social behaviors and feelings of wellbeing, including happiness, but also observing stories in the form of movies or books or other narratives of other people receiving help is also a very powerful stimulus for gratitude. Also giving gratitude is very powerful, but not as powerful as receiving gratitude. At least that's what the research says or observing powerful exchanges of gratitude between other individuals.

It turns out that the most potent form of gratitude practice is not a gratitude practice where you give gratitude or express gratitude, but rather where you receive gratitude, where you receive thanks. And this to me was very surprising. There are a number of studies about this now. One in particular that I think is interesting is called prefrontal activation while listening to a letter of gratitude read aloud by a coworker face-to-face, a NIRS study, N-I-R-S.

And some people are just calmer and have a harder time getting into action and an activity. It's just the way that we're wired. Some of us have autonomic nervous systems that are more geared towards parasympathetic calm states. One of the reasons I love bulldogs, not just my bulldog, is that they are very calm animals. In fact, they make no spontaneous movements unless there's something to respond to. And I find that incredibly relaxing. Other animals like pit bulls, who I also really like and enjoy, and other species, their tail's always wagging and that they're always in a position to make a movement at any second because they tend to ride at pretty high levels of autonomic arousal. They pop up really quickly when you say it's time to go for a walk. Costello does it one limb at a time, and sometimes he just goes back to sleep. And so there are people like that too.

I should also mention that if your eyes are getting tired doing whatever goal pursuit you happen to be engaged in, it's also a good idea to go into that panoramic vision mode. The easiest way to do that is to go outside or to be outside and to view a horizon and not look at any one particular point on the horizon. But if you're indoors, as I am now, you can also just relax your eyes, you know, blinking a few times and getting rid of that virgin's eye movement and try and visualize the corners of the room or the sides of the room, rather, the floor and the ceiling all at once.\",\n",

And because the nervous system and the immune system are in direct communication, this often isn't discussed, but not only does the immune system impact the brain, but the brain has networks, literally neural circuits that innervate structures like the spleen, like the thalamus that can communicate with the bone marrow, right? This isn't science fiction. This is really the case. In fact, there was an article that just came out in the journal Nature this month, and I'll provide a link to it in the show note captions, which is finally starting to acknowledge that yes, while these fields of immunology and brain science and psychology have existed as disparate silos up until now, it's oh so clear that the nervous system is the connection between all these different components of brain and body.\",\n",

But equally important is that when we have a mechanistic understanding or framework for how a protocol or set of protocols work, it makes it much easier to tweak those protocols and customize them to our unique needs. Okay, so with that said, the goal setting and pursuit circuitry essentially consists of four major stations in the brain, although it's important to point out that each of those stations has a number of other connections that are important for the whole goal setting and pursuit process. But we can distill things down to four major hubs or stations within the brain. And those are the basal ganglia, the lateral prefrontal cortex, and the orbital frontal cortex.

You actually have two of them, one on each side of the brain that is involved in circuits associated with arousal in driving levels of alertness. It's also involved in fear.

This perhaps should not be surprising. In order to learn something, we have to shift our nervous system into states that are somewhat uncomfortable. These should be safely uncomfortable states, but they should be uncomfortable states. And we're going to talk more about this as the episode continues, but any kind of successful learning or goal pursuit is going to involve errors. It's going to involve failures. It's going to involve frustration. It's going to involve anxiety. All of those states of mind and body, in fact, shift the brain into modes of so-called neuroplasticity. They give it the ability to change.

       "    'answer': \"So some people will talk about the dopamine hit that they get from somebody attractive that they like texting them back or the dopamine hit that they get from social media or the dopamine hit that they get from sugar or the dopamine hit that they get from this or from that. To be honest, the concept of dopamine hits is not one that I favor because in general, whenever people talk about dopamine hits, typically they're talking about activities such as social media, which dopamine may be involved at some level, but often it's the case that the behavior associated with that thing, in this case, social media, is more of the compulsive nature rather than an active seeking of something with positive anticipation. And that's really what dopamine is about, at least in the context of one of its major functions in the brain. Dopamine is really about motivation and desire and movement. And it makes sense why motivation, desire, and movement would be linked up through a common, in this case, neuromodulator or chemical like dopamine. Because throughout evolution, if we were excited for or motivated to pursue something, we had to move in order to get it, to obtain it.\",\n",

We want to respect and honor the power of the gut and this vagal pathway, but it's really neurons within your brain that drive the pursuit and decision-making. So what does this mean? Well, some people make too little dopamine. Some people make so little dopamine that they need prescription dopamine. They need L-Dopa. People with Parkinson's take L-Dopa and other compounds to increase dopamine because Parkinson's is associated with deficits in movement. It starts as a tremor, actually starts as some other things that are interesting we'll talk about in a moment, but Parkinson's is a depression. It's a blunting of motivation and mood and affect, and it's a tremor. And then eventually in severe conditions, it's challenges in speaking and walking.\",\n",

And then of course, there are areas of the brain that are involved in movement that are linked up with those areas involved in motivation. That makes perfect sense. Why would you have a brain area involved in motivation if you couldn't actually do something with that motivation? So the way that your brain is designed is when there's an increase in dopamine in the mesolimbic reward pathway, there are signals sent to an area of the brain called the striatum. We're going to spend a little bit of time today in the striatum. It's got a dorsal part, meaning an upper part, and a ventral part, which means a lower part. And the dopamine sent to those areas places us, excuse me, into modes of action to pursue particular things. Sugar or sweet tastes, I should say to be more specific, have an incredibly potent ability to activate dopamine release within the mesolimbic reward pathway.

So you can start to see how this is a beautifully designed system. And you can also see how it's a perfect system for desire and pursuit of anything, not just sandwiches, as I'm giving you in this somewhat trivial, but everyday and therefore applicable example. So just by understanding reward prediction error, and especially by understanding that a craving triggers a peak in dopamine that makes you motivated, but then drops your level of dopamine below baseline, which makes you even more motivated, you are already halfway through the conceptual aspect of today's podcast. Because if you can understand that, you will understand why, for instance, when you initially want something or you think you want something, it puts you into motion, but then pretty quickly, you're starting to feel the pain of not having that, and that is also contributing to your desire to pursue that thing.\",\n",

Basically, after I finish that cognitive work bout, that 90 minute work bout, I do some form of physical exercise for about an hour. The data all point to the fact that working out hard for longer than an hour can actually be detrimental because of the way that it raises cortisol and cortisol can be a good thing if it's appropriately timed and in the appropriate low levels, but you don't want to have your cortisol levels up throughout the day or have big spikes of cortisol repeatedly.

The particular form of exercise is either weight training or it can be endurance training, but the endurance training and the weight training actually have to be limited to about 60 minutes, not much longer. Now this is important because it's been shown over and over again that if one exercises too long with weights or endurance exercise, that cortisol levels go high enough that it starts to inhibit the testosterone and even the estrogen pathways. This is why I believe people who over-exercise or exercise a lot can lose their menstrual cycles. They stop menstruating. It's why you get suppressions in testosterone if people train too long and too hard. The cutoff has always been, you know, 60 to 75 minutes of the hard work part.\",\n",

It also turns out that you can leverage something interesting about exercise and nerve to muscle work in ways that can benefit cognitive function and focus. And it has to do with the way that your body and your nervous system predict bouts of intense focused effort. So let's say you're doing resistance training two or three times a week, maybe even four times a week, and you're doing it consistently at a given time. There are clocks, literally biological clocks within the liver and within the brain that learn to predict that focus and that intense work. If you are trying to get intense cognitive work done, you might try scheduling that cognitive work on the days when you don't do physical training at the same time when you normally would do that intense focused physical training.\",\n",

And I covered two papers during that episode, one that showed that indeed brain areas involved in attention, brain areas involved in focus and cognition and memory, those are engaged to a greater degree when there is low levels of white noise playing in the background. The other paper that's really interesting did brain imaging and showed that areas of the brain that are associated with dopamine release are increased by low levels of white noise.\",\n",

And the reason for that is we often don't see failure up close when it comes to people pursuing their goals. But if we are in the presence of people whose values we share, who have a similar commitment to doing something, and we see up close that they sometimes have those days where they fail or we have the vulnerability to show when we failed, that can actually increase our resolve that the goals that we're trying to achieve are actually possible.

And the answer lies in two things. One, the level of stress and therefore the level of hormones that are released in response to that stress, the duration over which the stress response occurs.

That said, I think this all again speaks to the importance of arriving at minimal effective dosage.

It wasn't about cooling the chest alone or just cooling the palms. It was about allowing cold to pass through the palms because of the unique vasculature that's there, these AVAs, allowed these subjects to do far more work per unit time. And the important thing is that if they were to come back after doing 600 pull-ups or 500 pull-ups, you might say, well, wow, that's going to create a situation where recovery is going to be absolutely impossible. They could come back, not use the cooling, and they still saw a highly significant increase in the amount or the number of pull-ups or dips or bench press weight that they could do, okay?

And that is because when one engages in exercise or muscular output of any kind, strength or endurance exercise, the range of temperatures under which a muscle can perform is actually very narrow. There's an enzyme called pyruvate kinase, which is critical to muscle contractions. And pyruvate kinase can only function in a very narrow range of temperatures. If that temperature gets too hot, meaning if the muscle heats up locally, whether or not by running or cycling or swimming or weightlifting, the ability for that muscle to continue to contract is reduced and eventually is short-circuited completely. And I think this is a much under explored, or at least a much under discussed aspect of so-called muscular failure or the failure of one to continue to endure in running. So for instance, when you run as compared to a bench press or something, you don't stop running because you can't actually contract the muscles further, but somehow signals about the heating up of muscular tissue are conveyed to the brain. There's a crosstalk there.\",\n",

So just bringing the body temperature down to baseline. If you can do that, the sooner you can do that after a workout, the sooner that the muscle will recover, that the tendons will recover, and that the person, you, can get back into more endurance training, more weight training, et cetera. So cold actually can be a very powerful tool for recovery, but to maximize return to baseline levels of temperature, it's my belief based on the studies that are published in this book, as well as my discussions with my colleague, Craig Heller, and in reviewing the literature overall, that just simply cooling the entire body by jumping into an ice bath or a cold shower is not the best way to go.

It's not quite hitting failure, but you're really pushing the system to the point where you are not ready to do another set and yet you begin another set. You're not necessarily psychologically ready. I'll talk more about some of the adaptations that this causes in terms of stroke volume in a few minutes when we talk about how it is that work of this sort can increase our heart's ability to deliver blood and oxygen to our lungs and other tissues. I'm going to get very specific about how to breathe during these different types of protocols and what's happening at the level of the heart. But I want to make sure I touch on the fourth protocol, which is high-intensity aerobic conditioning. So HIT has these two forms, anaerobic and aerobic, and you just heard about anaerobic. High-intensity aerobic conditioning also involves about three to 12 sets, starting off, of course, with fewer sets as you're getting into this training, and then extending into more sets as one parameter you could expand.\",\n",

And that is, I take the stance that behavioral tools, that is specific actions that we take and specific actions that we avoid, form the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. So things like viewing morning sunlight and exercise are behavioral tools. They don't require the ingestion of anything. Within the realm of behavioral tools, there are also some don'ts or do nots that can greatly enhance our mental health, physical health, and performance, such as avoiding bright light exposure to your eyes between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.\",\n",

So if you were to ask me what has changed significantly since the time that you wrote The 4-Hour Body, I would say that rather than looking for areas to optimize, I am looking where I can very deliberately de-optimize certain areas to increase sense of well-being. Where can I de-optimize? Where can I stop measuring? Where can I stop reading books? Which areas can I ignore completely? What types of information can I just excise from my life altogether for a period of time? Delete Twitter. Stop reading about books in X related to say AI or whatever it might be.

He talked about the fact that at least in his experiments on himself, the ingestion of vinegar did not seem to blunt blood glucose. And he was using continuous glucose monitors. These incidentally, another example of where Ferris was early to the game and the rest of us are kind of just in his wake. He talked about the use of blood glucose monitors. Those I think at the time were implanted below the skin. Nowadays, they're less invasive blood glucose monitors, things like levels and so forth. And these are actually becoming pretty popular. I've worn one of these before. They're actually pretty informative. I learned for instance, that when I go in the sauna, that I experience a sharp rise in blood glucose.

We talk about how certain types of sugars can indeed be addictive in the same way that certain drugs of abuse and behaviors can become addictive. So in other words, how sugar actually changes the way that the brain works.

So that's a great benefit for those of you that want to be strong and also want to maintain cardiovascular fitness, but you don't want to add muscular size. And of course, for all of you that want to add muscular size, it's well-established that increasing your strength will allow you then to return to patterns of hypertrophy training that will allow you to use heavier weights and therefore induce greater hypertrophy. So there are oh so many reasons to incorporate these strength training protocols. So the way that Dr. Andy Galpin suggested one do it, and was the way that I did it, is to use this three by five protocol. The three by five protocol is very straightforward.

Now, we haven't talked too much about melatonin, but melatonin is a hormone that is inhibited by light. It's actually prevented by light. And melatonin is the hormone that allows you to fall asleep easily. Now I'm not talking about supplementing melatonin. I'm talking about melatonin that you naturally produce from your pineal. So the protocol is very simple. Get outside in the afternoon or evening for 10 to 30 minutes, take your sunglasses off, get some bright light, get some natural light in your eyes. If you can't do that, probably better to just stay with standard artificial lights inside. Don't crank them up, but just start to dim them. Again, this would be a time to avoid blue blockers.\",\n",

So viewing bright light in the late evening hours and nighttime hours is really not good for your sleep quality and your ability to fall and stay asleep. So for most people, a simple rule of thumb is going to be avoid bright artificial lights of all colors. And in particular overhead, bright artificial lights between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. That's right, between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m., avoid those bright artificial lights as much as possible.

And so the logic there is very simple but also very powerful, and that is that whatever qualities are desired, consensually desired, if there's some heritable basis to those, then those increase in frequency over time. And so, and in the human case, these two causal processes of sexual selection are related to each other in that the mate preferences of one sex basically set the ground rules for competition in the opposite sex. So if, for example, hypothetically women preferred to mate with men who were able and willing to devote resources to them, then that would create competition among men to claw their way, you know, and beat out other men in resource acquisition and then displaying that their willingness to commit that to a particular woman. And same with women, though. And this is one of the interesting things about humans is that we have mutual mate choice, which is not true in all species. And that is that it's not just a matter of you selecting someone to be your mate. They have to reciprocally select you.\",\n",

And so throughout today's discussion, you'll notice that I'm wrapped with attention, trying to extract as much information as I can from Dr. Buss about the real science of human mate selection and mating strategy.

Now, it's well-known in humans that both males and females who have elevated levels of testosterone will engage in more novelty-seeking. And I do want to point out that even individuals without testes have testosterone, and peaks in testosterone have similar effects, regardless of whether or not someone has ovaries or testes. Testosterone increases generally lead to more foraging, more novelty seeking, increases in libido, and increases in desire to mate. So it is the case that increases in testosterone promote competitive and foraging type behaviors in humans and in non-human mammals. But it's also true that competition itself can increase androgens such as testosterone. I want to repeat that. Competitive environments themselves can increase testosterone. Now, some people have come to the conclusion that if you win, your testosterone goes up, and if you lose, your testosterone goes down. And to some extent that's true, but that's not a direct effect on the gonads.\",\n",

Wim Hof, also called AKA the Iceman, has this breathing that's similar to TUMO breathing, as it was originally called, involves basically hyperventilating and then doing some exhales and some breath holds. A couple of things about that, it should never be done near water. People who have done it near water, unfortunately, have drowned. It's certainly not for everybody, and I'm not here to either promote it nor discourage people from doing it. But I think we should ask ourselves, what is the net effect of that?

I don't want these interleukins elevated. But guess what? The inflammation response is also an important component of that innate immune system that allows us to combat infections.\",\n",

       "    'answer': \"In utero, that's true, but the way that cannabis seems to work, at least from the studies I was able to identify, is that it promotes circulating estrogen in the body and therefore can counteract some of the masculinizing effects of things like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone on primary and secondary sexual characteristics. So I mentioned this because, you know, I think nowadays marijuana use is far more widespread and certainly during puberty, it can have profound effects on these hormonal systems. And so we'll do another episode that goes really deep into this, but yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity by increasing aromatase. Most everyone can appreciate that drinking during pregnancy is not good for the developing fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a well-established negative outcome of pregnancy. And it's something that there are cognitive effects that are really bad. There's actually physical malformation, et cetera. So drinking during pregnancy, not good. Probably drinking during puberty, not good either because alcohol in particular, certain things like beer, but other grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity. Now, this isn't just about protecting young boys from estrogenic activity.\",\n",

Actually, you can recall when the first papers about kispeptin came out. And basically, kispeptin is a peptide that is naturally made within the brain, and it's upstream of some of the hypothalamic signals that activate the pituitary for sake of hormone production and reproduction. So I'll just walk you through this pathway. It's actually quite simple. You've got the pituitary, you're now familiar with the pituitary, and the pituitary releases two different hormones in both males and females. It releases luteinizing hormone, and it releases follicle stimulating hormone.\",\n",

And long-term potentiation involves a couple of cellular mechanisms that are going to be relevant to our discussion about treatments to undo fear. And I'll just throw out a couple of the names of some of those cellular elements right now. The main one is the so-called NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. And what this is, is this is a little docking site, like a little parking slot on a neuron. And when a neuron gets activated very strongly, like from an intense event, in the example of my friend, the intense event, almost certainly activated NMDA receptors related to their concept of protecting their property in their cars, the break into their car caused the NMDA receptor to be activated. Normally that NMDA receptor is not easily activated.\",\n",

And long-term potentiation translates to a change in connectivity so that later you don't need that intense event for the neuron to become active again. Let me clarify a little bit of this. The NMDA receptor is gated by intense experience. One way you could think about this is typically I walk in my home, I might make some food and sit down at my kitchen table, and I don't think anything about explosions.\",\n",

Long-term potentiation, or LTP, as the acronym goes, is the strengthening of connections between neurons as a consequence of their repeated firing very closely together in time. Okay, there's a lot more to it, but if you've ever heard the phrase fire together, wire together, sometimes that is misattributed to Donald Hebb, who did talk about neuroplasticity.

It's used for creating new associations in our nervous system. And so the activation of the NMDA receptor and LTP, and it involves some other things that you may have heard of, like brain-derived nootropic factors and calcium entry, things that we can leave for a discussion for a future time. But basically a whole cascade of events happen within cells that then make just even the mere thought of something or somebody or some event that happened able to activate that threat reflex, okay?

At the beginning of the episode, we talked about a form of neuroplasticity called long-term potentiation involving the NMDA receptor. Just to refresh your memory a little bit, it basically says that if a set of neurons is very electrically active, it's likely that over time, those neurons will communicate with themselves more easily because of changes in things like NMDA receptor activity, the recruitment of additional receptors, et cetera. It's essentially a cellular and molecular explanation for how something goes from unlearned to learned to reflexive.

But really it's the serotonin 2A receptor selectivity of psilocybin that is leading to all the excitement that you hear about in terms of psilocybin as a therapeutic tool. Let me say that from a slightly different angle. There are data that I'll talk about today, which show that one, although in most cases, two psilocybin journeys done with particular dosages of psilocybin lead to maximal binding or occupancy of those serotonin 2A receptors in ways that lead to significant and unprecedented relief for major depression. In fact, you'll soon learn that the clinical trials for psilocybin are outperforming standard therapy and outperforming so-called SSRIs and various other antidepressants in terms of providing depression relief in ways that are frankly staggering, not just to me, but to the psychiatric community at large.\",\n",

You could do that before and during and after, you could do it during and after, or you could do it after. Now, there are other reasons to do deliberate heat exposure that have nothing to do with cardiovascular effects, nothing to do with growth hormone or anything of that sort, but rather have to do with improvements in mood and mental health. In fact, the data related to sauna and other forms of deliberate heat exposure improving mood are very impressive, both at the mechanistic level and in terms of the long-term consequences that people experience. First of all, we need to ask, how is it that deliberate heat exposure can improve our mood and wellbeing? Well, it turns out that it improves mood and wellbeing, but it also improves our capacity to feel good in response to things that would ordinarily make us feel somewhat good. Now, this is not a situation where you're going to be walking around grinning ear to ear in response to nothing at all, simply because you went in a sauna.\",\n",

The paper included some subjective reports of that sort, but then was able to link those to changes in brain circuitry and brain activation in response to music using neuroimaging. So in that way, it really points to both the subjective and structural and functional changes that psilocybin can bring about through that expanded connectivity between brain areas. Because remember during the psilocybin session, it's not as if music or the perception of music is specifically being looked at or focused on in these studies. Rather, music is playing. People are in the eye mask. They're feeling all sorts of things. They're breathing. They're hearing. They're touching. It's all happening all at once. There's a peak. It's long. There's a long taper.

And again, it all boils back down to the selectivity of psilocybin to bind that serotonin 2A receptor.

Those brain-wide changes seem to change one's reflection on oneself, so-called ego dissolution, changes in mood that are stable over time, et cetera, et cetera. It was all pretty straightforward. With ketamine, it's clear there are multiple mechanisms involved. And perhaps most importantly with ketamine, it's that immediate relief that occurs day of or close to day of treatment and in the days afterwards. And it's that long-term relief that very likely is the consequence of NMDA receptor suppression, burst activity in neurons within these mood-related circuits, BDNF being released and changing neural circuits, strengthening them in order to give elevated mood as a consequence of that bursting activity, and ketamine mimicking BDNF. In other words, ketamine acting more or less like a growth factor in the brain in order to make sure that whatever changes occur in those neural circuits to elevate mood are durable, that they really are reinforced and last over time.\",\n",

It builds a certain amount of internal arousal in me to know, okay, I've got 72 hours to complete something and it's now game time. I like the game time before the game time. Before a podcast, I'll put in anywhere from, you know, several days to weeks or even months in preparation. So it's really elastic depending on the topic. But when it came to exams in school or if it comes to writing deadlines, I consider the shipping of the product or the presentation of the live event that I happen to be doing as the second game or event.

So animals first bit with their teeth and Darwin argued that through evolution, just showing the teeth alone became an aggressive sign because it started from biting. Or what I find is a beautiful example, and this is work partly done by Adam Anderson now at Cornell, is the emotional expression of disgust. So disgust, which comes from the line, disgustia, distaste, right, is spitting something out of your mouth. Now, what Adam showed is that the musculature patterns of activation and the temporal sequence of activation, when you experience moral disgust, are the same as when you spit a bitter taste out of your mouth, right? So again, so there's a functional antecedent spitting something out. And through evolution, the argument was that it became an expression of emotion and you express disgust just as if you're spitting something out of your mouth, even though in the case of moral disgust, there's nothing you're spitting out of your mouth.\",\n",

Now I realize that some of you are probably still asking, how can it be that stress diminishes health and performance and stress also enhances health and performance? And the answer lies in two things. One, the level of stress and therefore the level of hormones that are released in response to that stress, the duration over which the stress response occurs. But the key variable here is that our cognitive understanding about what stress does impacts whether or not our physiology goes down the direction of debilitating or enhancing effects of stress.

There's hope that eventually there's a use here that makes sense for a brain interface to bring AI as a tool embedded in the brain that a human can use to augment their capabilities. I think that's pretty far down the road for us, but definitely on a desired roadmap. In the near term, we really are focused on people with terrible medical problems that have no options right now. With regard to motor control, our mutual friend recently departed, Krishna Shenoy, was a giant in this field of motor prosthesis. It just so happens that his work was foundational for a lot of people that work in this area, including us, and he was an advisor to Neuralink. That work was farther along than most other work for addressing any function that lives on the surface of the brain.

Dr. Williams is a medical doctor and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine. His laboratory and clinic focus on depression and other mood disorders. They focus specifically on the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation, which is a brain stimulation technique that can either activate or quiet specific brain circuits, as well as circuits within the body, in order to treat depression and other mood disorders. Other laboratories and clinics use TMS. What sets apart the work of Nolan Williams and colleagues is that they combine TMS with other treatments. And some of those treatments are among the more cutting edge that you've probably heard about these days, including Ibogaine, psilocybin, MDMA, cannabis, DMT, and other drugs that at this point in time are experimental in terms of clinical trials, but that at least the preliminary data show hold great promise for the treatment of depression and other mood disorders.\",\n",

And so, you know, one of the mysteries about depression is that it's not that tractable to pharmacological therapy. So if you look at people who suffer with depression, about a third of people see significant benefit from modern SSRI and related antidepressant drugs. About a third see very tiny benefit and about a third see no benefit at all. And part of the reason is because maybe our term depression is too big a bucket. Depression is actually many different biological disorders and only a subset of those are helped by SSRIs and will need different therapies for the other ones. That's certainly part of it.

Well, you could play with this if you want. I don't see any real challenge to this provided the odor is a safe one and it doesn't wake you up and the tone is a safe one and doesn't wake you up. You could do this by having a metronome, for instance, while learning something, playing in the background or particular music, and then have that very faintly while you sleep.

However, right now, I just want to emphasize how the data impact my day and how I structure my day in a way that I can incorporate physical movement in a way that supports my brain and health. Basically, after I finish that cognitive work bout, that 90 minute work bout, I do some form of physical exercise for about an hour. The data all point to the fact that working out hard for longer than an hour can actually be detrimental because of the way that it raises cortisol and cortisol can be a good thing if it's appropriately timed and in the appropriate low levels, but you don't want to have your cortisol levels up throughout the day or have big spikes of cortisol repeatedly. So keeping workouts relatively short can definitely help with that. And certainly if you're training hard, 60 minutes or less should be more than sufficient.\",\n",

So first, I'm just going to tell you what I found to be the maximum amount of growth hormone release as it relates to a particular form of exercise. The particular form of exercise is either weight training or it can be endurance training, but the endurance training and the weight training actually have to be limited to about 60 minutes, not much longer. Now this is important because it's been shown over and over again that if one exercises too long with weights or endurance exercise, that cortisol levels go high enough that it starts to inhibit the testosterone and even the estrogen pathways. This is why I believe people who over-exercise or exercise a lot can lose their menstrual cycles. They stop menstruating. It's why you get suppressions in testosterone if people train too long and too hard. The cutoff has always been, you know, 60 to 75 minutes of the hard work part.\",\n",

But I've talked on previous episodes and there are a lot of others who have talked out there about how to clamp cortisol, how to keep cortisol more reduced. This is also one of the reasons why you can imagine that various individuals, either for competition or just for their own purposes, rely on testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone, not just for weight training, but for endurance exercise. So this is one of the reasons why every once in a while, professional cyclists will get popped for performance-injecting drugs, meaning they'll get caught. And it's not just that they're increasing red blood cells through EPO and things of that sort. Oftentimes they're also taking testosterone, not because they want to be large or have massively hypertrophied muscles, but because they're injecting testosterone, they don't have to worry about cortisol-induced reductions in testosterone.

So a shared us that promotes understanding and bolsters a sense of agency and gratitude and bolsters the generative drive, like that's great for both people when they're not in the us, when one goes one way and one goes the other, because that happens all the time in relationships too, right? Go to work at different places or, you know, we bolster ourselves outside of relationships if we see what the magic bridge of the relationship can be. So we can look there for problems. Like, why am I anxious? Why are you anxious? Why are we anxious? Why are you only anxious when we're we and not, you know, we can look for all that and we should, right?\",\n",

One of the things that we will do is link to the incredible videos of these mice that have selective stimulation of neurons in the VMH, DIUS and the other studies that you've done. Whenever I teach, I show those videos at some point with the caveats and warnings that are required when one is about to see a video of a mouse trying to mate with another mouse or mating with another mouse. And they seem both to be quite happy about the mating experience, at least as far as we know as observers of mice. And then upon stimulation of those VMH neurons, one of the mice essentially tries to kill the other mouse. And then when that stimulation is stopped, they basically go back to hanging out.

Several times during the discussion so far, we've hit on this idea that the same behavior can reflect different states and different states can converge on multiple behaviors as well. You had a paper not long ago about mounting behavior, which I found fascinating. Maybe you could tell us about that result because to me, it really speaks to the fact that mounting behavior can in one context be sexual and in another context actually be related to, we presume, dominance. And I think that my friends who practice jujitsu will say, when I talk about that result, they say, of course, mounting the other person and dominating them, there's nothing sexual about it. It's about overtaking them physically, literally being on their next side, as opposed to on their own, lying on their own back. It's just fascinating, very primitive. And yet I think speaks to this idea that mounting behavior might be one of the most fundamental ways in which animals and perhaps even humans express dominance and or sexual interactions. Yep. That's a fascinating question. And it was harder to figure out than you might have thought.\",\n",

The sativa varieties tend to make people feel a little bit less susceptible to pain and noxious stimuli, which are basically stimuli that you don't like. So the sativa varieties are often prescribed or are used in the recreational context for pain management and relief. Basically, the sativa variety is known to include a sort of head-biased effect. So here we're talking about subjective effects, and of course, these will vary from one individual to the next. Some people will smoke cannabis sativa or ingest cannabis sativa orally, and will feel an entirely different array of effects. But most people, the majority of people experience a sort of head centered, high alertness focus and a sense that they're more creative. Contrast that with the indica varieties of cannabis. And when people smoke or eat or ingest indica varieties, the psychoactive components of indica, and again, this is pure indica, so not hybridized with sativa at all, but just pure indica, tend to lead to more full-bodied effects.\",\n",

And we could use a broad brush and say, well, they just like being high.

       "    'answer': \"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is Robert Green. Robert Green is an author who has written more than five best-selling books, including The 48 Laws of Power, The Laws of Human Nature, and Mastery. He did his bachelor's training at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Robert Greene's books are both unique and important for several reasons, not the least of which is that they explore the interaction between the psychology of self, self-exploration, and the psychology of human interaction, all rooted in history and modern culture, and at the same time, in a way that pertains to everybody. I first learned about Robert's work from reading the book Mastery, which to my mind is a brilliant exploration and a practical tool for how to think about and pursue one's purpose. Whenever I'm asked for book suggestions, I always include Mastery in my top three recommendations.\",\n",

I teach people to think of the pain and categorize it. Does the pain mean that if you put weight on this, you're going to re-injure your ankle, for example? Or does it simply mean that your body is healing and the pain is a sign that gradually things are getting back to normal? And so you can modify the way you process pain based on what your brain tells you the pain means. And that's true for emotional pain as well. And particularly where I think a strategy that really helps is if you think of an interpersonal problem or a threat of something coming as an opportunity to do something to ameliorate the situation. So it's not just it's happening to you, but something that you can influence and do something about. So it's blending the receptive with the active response that I think can make a difference. So you try and process it in a way that gives you a deeper understanding of what's happening.\",\n",

So now you have what, at least I would like to think, is a fairly complete understanding of the different varieties of cannabis, at least at a broad sweep, and the different biological effects that they can have, at least in terms of the major receptors and in retrograde signaling, et cetera, et cetera. Now let's take a step back into the real world and evaluate or think about what happens when somebody smokes cannabis or ingests cannabis by way of edible or tincture or something of that sort. Cannabis is very fast to enter the bloodstream. In fact, within 30 seconds, it's going to enter the brain and permeate throughout the brain and body.\",\n",

Again, without ever going anywhere near cannabis, we have these endogenous cannabinoids. Endogenous cannabinoids are floating around in us, or I should say they are released in us in particular ways, bind to these receptors and cause changes in mood, appetite, et cetera. They have many different effects on the brain and body. We will talk about those. But just like with nicotine, there are substances in the outside world. In this case, cannabis contains these substances. So things like THC and like CBD that when ingested by smoking or vaping or by ingesting edibles also will park in those same receptors, the cannabinoid receptors and lead to biological effects. Now it's a little bit misleading because we call them cannabinoid receptors as if they were there to bind cannabis, or just like we call the nicotine receptors, nicotinic receptors, it makes it seem as if they were there in order to bind nicotine from tobacco.\",\n",

There are also naturally occurring differences in the strains of plants, and the cannabis plant is no exception. So for instance, in the context of a discussion about cannabis and its medicinal uses and recreational uses, we need to distinguish between the sativa variety, the indica variety, a variety called ruderalis that's not often discussed, and hybrids of sativa, indica, and ruderalis. Before diving into the different strains of cannabis and how they impact the brain and body both similarly and differently, I want to emphasize that the cannabis plant contains a number of different psychoactive compounds. Now, the most powerful of those compounds is THC. The technical name for it is Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. But THC, as I'll refer to it, is just one of the psychoactive and biologically active compounds within cannabis plants.\",\n",

You can try various other things. That's what works for me. In addition, I use low level white noise. This is something that is supported by quality peer reviewed data. We covered this on the episode on hearing and balance, but it turns out that white noise, which is essentially all frequencies of sound, or all frequencies of sound that we can perceive, mixed up kind of randomly, there's no structure to it, turned on at a low volume, not with headphones most of the time, puts the brain into a state that's optimal for learning and workflow. And I covered two papers during that episode, one that showed that indeed brain areas involved in attention, brain areas involved in focus and cognition and memory, those are engaged to a greater degree when there is low levels of white noise playing in the background. The other paper that's really interesting did brain imaging and showed that areas of the brain that are associated with dopamine release are increased by low levels of white noise.\",\n",

I can make my voice higher, although I'm not very good at that. My voice starts to crack and I can make my voice lower, although not as low as Costello's snore. So it has an envelope, it has a container. White noise has no container. It's like all the colors of the rainbow spread out together, which is actually what you get when you get white light. White noise is analogous to white light. So one of the reasons why hearing a lot of white noise is analogous to white light. So one of the reasons why hearing a lot of white noise during development for long periods of time can be detrimental to the development of the auditory system is that these tonotopic maps don't form normally.\",\n",

And there are a number of different ways that that can happen, but they all require this thing that we're calling neuroplasticity. We're going to have a large number of discussions about neuroplasticity in depth, but the most important thing to understand is that it is indeed a two-phase process. What governs the transition between alert and focused and these deep rest and deep sleep states is a system in our brain and body, a certain aspect of the nervous system called the autonomic nervous system. And it is immensely important to understand how this autonomic nervous system works. It has names like the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system, which frankly are complicated names because they're a little bit misleading. Sympathetic is the one that's associated with more alertness. Parasympathetic is the one that's associated with more calmness. And it gets really misleading because the sympathetic nervous system sounds like sympathy, and then people think it's related to calm.\",\n",

Those two things are always in kind of push-pull with one another, like a seesaw or push or push pull, however you want to think about it. One physiological side, meaning that big, deep inhale, short second inhale also through the nose and then long exhale to completely lungs empty is known to restore the level of balance in the sympathetic parasympathetic neural circuitries and is the fastest way to reintroduce calm.

If we push ourselves and stay awake, we're okay. We can do that for a night or two, but almost always we are asleep for a portion of it and we are awake for a portion of it.

I do want to use this as an opportunity to raise something about the so-called Uberman schedule, not to be confused with the Huberman schedule. Fortunately, no one has confused those yet. Some years ago, there was a discussion about the so-called Uberman schedule, meaning the Superman schedule. So that's Huberman without an H, which I have nothing to do with. If you read your Nietzsche, this will have a subtext. But regardless, the Uberman schedule, as I understand, is one in which the person elects to sleep in 90-minute bouts spread throughout the day and night in an attempt to get more productivity and or reduce their overall sleep need. There was a paper published recently that explored whether or not this is good or bad for us. Maybe you just give us the take-home message on that. Yeah, so these Uberman-like schedules, and there's lots of different forms of that.\",\n",

It's not quite hitting failure, but you're really pushing the system to the point where you are not ready to do another set and yet you begin another set. You're not necessarily psychologically ready. I'll talk more about some of the adaptations that this causes in terms of stroke volume in a few minutes when we talk about how it is that work of this sort can increase our heart's ability to deliver blood and oxygen to our lungs and other tissues. I'm going to get very specific about how to breathe during these different types of protocols and what's happening at the level of the heart. But I want to make sure I touch on the fourth protocol, which is high-intensity aerobic conditioning. So HIT has these two forms, anaerobic and aerobic, and you just heard about anaerobic. High-intensity aerobic conditioning also involves about three to 12 sets, starting off, of course, with fewer sets as you're getting into this training, and then extending into more sets as one parameter you could expand.\",\n",

It's clear that it's vital for the functioning of the body and the mind, and there are clear longevity benefits. There are a lot of reasons why that's true, but the main one is that if we have good energy utilization in our musculature and in our blood, in our vascular system, and in our oxygenating system, our lungs, the so-called cardiovascular system, respiratory system, and musculature, the body and brain function much better. There are so many papers now, so much data to support that.

So let's first talk about breathing or respiration. We breathe a couple of different ways, but let's just remind ourselves why we breathe. We breathe to bring oxygen into our system and we breathe to get rid of carbon dioxide. And we need both oxygen and carbon dioxide in order to utilize fuel and for our brain and body to work. It's not that oxygen is good and carbon dioxide is bad. They have to be present in the appropriate ratios. So one thing that is very clear is our ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles and to our brain is going to be important for our ability to generate muscular effort, especially of the kind I was talking about today, but also weight training and other forms of skill-based effort, et cetera, and our ability to think.\",\n",

In fact, we could think about eating disorders like bulimia as an unmasking of that mechanism without the so-called top-down control, without the mechanisms that we use to regulate our behavior.

       "    'answer': \"And it is largely dependent on the pH, that is the acidity of your mouth, which is largely dependent on how much saliva you're producing and the mineral content of that saliva. Keep that in mind. I think it's a very important point. Now, another key point is that next to your teeth, right, you have your gums, the gingiva, as's called. Now the gingiva provides a really important role in keeping the teeth stable. We don't often think of it like that, but even though that stuff seems gummy and soft, it is soft tissue. It is very important for fixing the teeth to the bone. It's not just about the roots that extend down into the jawbone below. The gums are very important for keeping the teeth where they are. There's actually a little ligament too, between gums and the teeth that resides a little bit deeper, but the gums form a critical barrier between the oral cavity and the deeper layers of what eventually is bone and into the general blood flow or bloodstream of the body. Now, this is so important to understand that the gums are a seal around the tooth.\",\n",

We'll talk about that and can get down into the bone and then can cause serious, serious issues. This is so-called periodontal disease and periodontal disease is associated with all sorts of really bad stuff, including Alzheimer's. Okay. This is not just some wellness culture, woo science leap to Alzheimer's. There's literally evidence that the specific bacterias that cause recession of the gums can cross the blood brain barrier if they make it into the general circulation and potentially cause plaques and tangles, some of the hallmark features of neural degeneration in Alzheimer's, okay? Probably not the only cause of Alzheimer's, but potentially one of the major causes. This is a new theory, but it's one that a lot of people are starting to pay attention to.\",\n",

So today we are going to address what determines the length of a hair or rather what determines how long a hair continues to grow before it ceases growing and eventually falls out. We're going to talk about what regulates those stem cells, what allows them to continue to produce hair or cease producing hair. And as we do that, you will learn all the biology in clear, simple terms, regardless of your background, that will really set the stage for understanding what we'll also talk about, which is how to slow hair loss or halt hair loss entirely, or even reverse hair loss. So we will talk about hormone-related hair loss in both men and women. We will talk about some of the mechanical and stress-related influences on hair loss. And we will talk about the chemical and mechanical approaches to halting and reversing hair loss.

First of all, it is being used in multiple tissues for different purposes in different clinics. So for instance, board certified physicians in the United States, Canada, and Europe are doing PRP injections into ovaries to try and expand the number of healthy follicles and eggs so that people can conceive later in life or even earlier in life if they don't have many follicles. People are getting PRP injections into their joints in order to try and support joint health. People are getting PRP injections into just about every tissue you can think of. However, PRP, despite what you may have heard, is not stem cells.

It will also highlight a really key theme that will come up several times in today's podcast, which is that there are both mechanical and chemical approaches to slowing and reversing hair loss. Mechanical approaches would be things as simple as massaging the scalp, but mechanical changes to the scalp can cause either hair loss or facilitate hair growth.

Some, maybe many, not all people who take these drugs, particularly in oral form, experience sexual dysfunction issues and other issues related to suppressing DHT. That said, my understanding is that these drugs are also quite useful, maybe even life-saving in some cases, for staving off certain forms of prostate cancer. What are your thoughts about finasteride to testosterone?

And remember there's blood vessels going into that area or rather capillaries that are feeding that area as well. After the catagen phase comes the telogen phase, which means rest. The telogen phase is a period in which no new hair proteins are being added by those stem cells. And during that telogen phase, that bulb down there at the bottom, instead of being nice and oval and really having a lot of space in it with all these different things like stem cells, starts to pinch off from the little tube that comes down from the surface of the skin that normally would have a hair in it. It starts to pinch off. And at some point, many hair follicles pinch off that bulb region and it recedes and dies.

Where can I de-optimize? Where can I stop measuring? Where can I stop reading books? Which areas can I ignore completely? What types of information can I just excise from my life altogether for a period of time? Delete Twitter. Stop reading about books in X related to say AI or whatever it might be.

A lot of these things which we think of as savory products have sugar added to them as well. And so we are consuming, I think, unhealthy levels of sugar in our diet. We're consuming a fair amount of additives given the processed food composition in our diet. And I think part of the reason this is happening, and I want to be very clear, I don't fault individuals out there for the composition of their diet necessarily because we have also made certain decisions in our country about what we subsidize, about what's cheaper and more expensive for people. And the cheapest foods, unfortunately, are often the most unhealthy foods, the most highly processed foods. If you are somebody who lives in a low-income neighborhood, a number of these neighborhoods don't even have grocery stores in them, which is a tragedy because you can't get fresh produce, etc. A lot of times your grocery shopping may be done at a local convenience store, at a 7-Eleven or somewhere else that may not have the array of fresh fruits and vegetables that you and your family need.\",\n",

Nonetheless, what this study illustrates is that there are chemicals in tears that are evoking or changing the biology of other individuals.

The other compound that's relevant both to men and women, or I should say people that are trying to optimize testosterone and or estrogen is Fidogia. Fidogia agrestis is actually an herb that increases the levels of what's called luteinizing hormone. Luteinizing hormone is a hormone that's released from the hypothalamus within the brain that travels to the gonads, either the ovaries or the testes, to stimulate the release of estrogen or testosterone. And Fidogea agrestis has been shown, albeit in a limited number of studies, to increase levels of luteinizing hormone and thereby levels of testosterone and estrogen in ways that some people find beneficial.

Okay, so that describes habits through the lens of neuroscience and biology. But as many of you are well aware, there are popular books about habits and there's a whole psychological literature about habits. And those two areas point to some very interesting aspects of habits that I think are worth mentioning. First of all, is this notion of immediate goal-based habits versus identity-based habits. Immediate goal-based habits are going to be habits that are designed to bring you a specific outcome as you do them. So each and every time you do them. So for instance, it might be that you want to develop a habit of getting, you know, 60 minutes of zone two cardio each day, or perhaps, you know, three, four times a week as we head into the new year.\",\n",

In other words, habits serve as flankers or markers for the passage of your day. Now, if that seems kind of hyper-neurotic or why would I want to structure my life like that? I would say that many people would do well to structure their life like that and to utilize habits, not just for sake of what you do during the habit, but because of the fact that the habits serve as a marker because of the way they can evoke dopamine release.

It doesn't even count actually going outside and seeing the sun, but perhaps we'll do that. And then other little tricks that I've learned over the years is one particular thing I love is literally drawing a line, a physical line on the ground. And you look at that line and you say, I'm going to train today and I'm going to accomplish this effort. I'm not going to walk past this line and into that training space until I'm ready to give that effort. And that may take a minute or 10 or whatever. But the physical barrier is very important to saying, like, I'm not just going to get through it.

So there's something going on there that's not clear. One idea is that the SSRIs actually can improve symptoms of depression or even remove symptoms of depression through so-called neuroplasticity by changing the way that neural circuits function. And there are many studies on this, but the main categories of studies on SSRIs that relate to neuroplasticity fall into two camps. One is that the ways in which SSRIs might, and I want to emphasize might, be able to trigger the production of more neurons in the brain, in particular areas of the hippocampus called the dentate gyrus and others that impact memory. This is important. We're going to come back to memory. The other is that the SSRIs have been shown in various scientific studies to reopen critical periods of plasticity.

In fact, there was a progressive and further reduction in OCD symptoms from the four to eight week period. Again, these are the people just taking the SSRI.

Now, we haven't talked too much about melatonin, but melatonin is a hormone that is inhibited by light. It's actually prevented by light.

So the protocol is very simple. Get outside in the afternoon or evening for 10 to 30 minutes, take your sunglasses off, get some bright light, get some natural light in your eyes. If you can't do that, probably better to just stay with standard artificial lights inside. Don't crank them up, but just start to dim them. Again, this would be a time to avoid blue blockers.\",\n",

Now, there are hormonal factors that are important. There are nutritional factors. But just to stick with the context of training, this is really going to frame a lot of our answers. And as you'll see, it's one of the reasons why I call hypertrophy training kind of idiot proof in terms of programming. Now the work is hard, difficult and all that, but the precision needed is a lot less than what we saw in power and strength. And so if you note there, like it's very important that you do it in this style with this intent and within these parameters.\",\n",

Outside of that, it comes out of the training and the feedback is immediate. That's powerful because if you look across the literature on exercise adherence, you'll see that that is in fact the number one predictor of effectiveness of any training program. So what that means is if you were to put any variable possible and figure out what is going to determine whether or not this program works. This is what we typically call the methods are many and the concepts are few. So the methods of exercise, the methods of strength training, the methods of hypertrophy training, which we'll talk about, are infinite.

And believe it or not, there are good data to support the fact that certain aspects of mania are associated with creativity. Now, we are long overdue for an episode about creativity, its neural circuit basis, its chemical basis here on the Huberman Lab Podcast. And certainly we will have that conversation.

When there's a reciprocity, when the person receiving understands something about the person that's giving to them and understands that the person is giving genuinely, for instance. So there's an environmental interaction. It's not just about receiving, it's receiving from somebody that you know genuinely wants to give. And likewise for the giver in that equation, the feelings of wellbeing are far greater when the person receiving whatever it is, money, food, assistance in some form or another, it could be physical assistance, et cetera. When the giver has knowledge that the person receiving it genuinely needed the thing that they are receiving.

These are very large positive effects. However, in researching this episode, I was completely surprised as to what constitutes an effective gratitude practice. I think like many of you would have thought that an effective gratitude practice simply involves writing down a few things or many things that we're grateful for, or thinking about those, or really making an effort to somaticize or feel some of the elements of gratitude while writing out that list or thinking about that list.\",\n",

       "    'answer': \"And I think it's important to recognize that some people are just more go, go, go, go, go, and no go. And some people are just calmer and have a harder time getting into action and an activity. It's just the way that we're wired. Some of us have autonomic nervous systems that are more geared towards parasympathetic calm states. One of the reasons I love bulldogs, not just my bulldog, is that they are very calm animals. In fact, they make no spontaneous movements unless there's something to respond to. And I find that incredibly relaxing. Other animals like pit bulls, who I also really like and enjoy, and other species, their tail's always wagging and that they're always in a position to make a movement at any second because they tend to ride at pretty high levels of autonomic arousal. They pop up really quickly when you say it's time to go for a walk. Costello does it one limb at a time, and sometimes he just goes back to sleep. And so there are people like that too. And so you have to know where you are and what particular goals you're trying to pursue.\",\n",

It kickstarts the deployment of those chemicals and those neural circuits that then allow you to be motivated for some period of time. But then that is a transient increase in autonomic arousal, which is why perhaps every 20 minutes or perhaps on the hour, you might stop, do a 30 second or 60 second visual target training, then lean back into your process of however it is that you are pursuing your goal. I should also mention that if your eyes are getting tired doing whatever goal pursuit you happen to be engaged in, it's also a good idea to go into that panoramic vision mode. The easiest way to do that is to go outside or to be outside and to view a horizon and not look at any one particular point on the horizon. But if you're indoors, as I am now, you can also just relax your eyes, you know, blinking a few times and getting rid of that virgin's eye movement and try and visualize the corners of the room or the sides of the room, rather, the floor and the ceiling all at once.\",\n",

But neither is the case. Again, set goals that are difficult to achieve, but that are not so lofty that they collapse your system and that you feel overwhelmed. And the important thing here is that how we perceive a goal, whether or not we think it's within reach or not, of course will vary depending on whether or not we are rested, depending on whether or not other aspects of our life are going well. I mean, we can think that we are hot on the heels of a lifetime goal and everything's going well, and then there'll be some crisis, interpersonal crisis, or there'll be a health crisis and you'll be shut down.

So if you're interested in the specifics of those protocols, please see those episodes. However, right now, I just want to emphasize how the data impact my day and how I structure my day in a way that I can incorporate physical movement in a way that supports my brain and health. Basically, after I finish that cognitive work bout, that 90 minute work bout, I do some form of physical exercise for about an hour. The data all point to the fact that working out hard for longer than an hour can actually be detrimental because of the way that it raises cortisol and cortisol can be a good thing if it's appropriately timed and in the appropriate low levels, but you don't want to have your cortisol levels up throughout the day or have big spikes of cortisol repeatedly. So keeping workouts relatively short can definitely help with that. And certainly if you're training hard, 60 minutes or less should be more than sufficient.\",\n",

So first, I'm just going to tell you what I found to be the maximum amount of growth hormone release as it relates to a particular form of exercise. The particular form of exercise is either weight training or it can be endurance training, but the endurance training and the weight training actually have to be limited to about 60 minutes, not much longer. Now this is important because it's been shown over and over again that if one exercises too long with weights or endurance exercise, that cortisol levels go high enough that it starts to inhibit the testosterone and even the estrogen pathways. This is why I believe people who over-exercise or exercise a lot can lose their menstrual cycles. They stop menstruating. It's why you get suppressions in testosterone if people train too long and too hard. The cutoff has always been, you know, 60 to 75 minutes of the hard work part.\",\n",

You also need to use your minds. I'm certainly familiar with wanting to get exercise, but also the requirement of needing to perform cognitive work throughout the day. It also turns out that you can leverage something interesting about exercise and nerve to muscle work in ways that can benefit cognitive function and focus. And it has to do with the way that your body and your nervous system predict bouts of intense focused effort. So let's say you're doing resistance training two or three times a week, maybe even four times a week, and you're doing it consistently at a given time. There are clocks, literally biological clocks within the liver and within the brain that learn to predict that focus and that intense work. If you are trying to get intense cognitive work done, you might try scheduling that cognitive work on the days when you don't do physical training at the same time when you normally would do that intense focused physical training.\",\n",

I realize that there are some genetic freaks out there or people that are chemically assisted that can recover from very intense, long bouts of exercise, but most people don't do well through long bouts of intense exercise on a regular basis and limiting their intense exercise to 60 minutes or less, that doesn't include the warmup, is going to be beneficial. See the episode on Toolkit for Fitness if you'd like details on that.

So this is important to know. If one places more specificity on negative emotions, it also can enhance one's kind of experience of those negative emotions. Now, that means that this is a two-sided blade, all right? This isn't always a good thing.

We covered this on the episode on hearing and balance, but it turns out that white noise, which is essentially all frequencies of sound, or all frequencies of sound that we can perceive, mixed up kind of randomly, there's no structure to it, turned on at a low volume, not with headphones most of the time, puts the brain into a state that's optimal for learning and workflow. And I covered two papers during that episode, one that showed that indeed brain areas involved in attention, brain areas involved in focus and cognition and memory, those are engaged to a greater degree when there is low levels of white noise playing in the background. The other paper that's really interesting did brain imaging and showed that areas of the brain that are associated with dopamine release are increased by low levels of white noise.\",\n",

Dopamine is a neuromodulator, meaning it's a chemical that's released in our brain and body, but mostly in our brain, that modulates, meaning controls the likelihood that certain brain areas will be active and other brain areas won't be active. And dopamine is associated with motivation. Dopamine is associated with craving. Motivation is associated with all sorts of different things, including movement. But what this study so nicely shows is that white noise can really enhance the activity of neurons in what's called the substantia nigra VTA.

Tickets for the two events, again, Seattle on May 17th and Portland on May 18th, are both available at hubermanlab.com slash tour. Before we begin with today's episode, I want to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Thesis.\",\n",

Now I realize that some of you are probably still asking, how can it be that stress diminishes health and performance and stress also enhances health and performance? And the answer lies in two things. One, the level of stress and therefore the level of hormones that are released in response to that stress, the duration over which the stress response occurs. But the key variable here is that our cognitive understanding about what stress does impacts whether or not our physiology goes down the direction of debilitating or enhancing effects of stress. Okay, so we've got a condition here where people are being informed very differently about what stress does. In one case, it's the stress is bad message.

Thyroid hormone is involved in many, many things, including bone health and tissue health generally. So essentially every biological process in your body is impacted by thyroid hormone.

The generative drive is really what's the issue or the lack of generative drive in any of those conversations. It seems one could circle back to that and go, okay, well, someone's not asking the right questions and therefore not doing the right things because they don't either have a sense of agency or they don't have gratitude for the situation they're in, including their own ability to do that, right? So when you hear, you know, people aren't showing up for the relationship, they're not showing up or, you know, she's not showing up. Or again, let's make the pan statement go in the other direction that, you know, that somebody just wants a lot of attention, right? They just need an excess amount of attention.

I raise this because one thing that's often overheard or that I've overheard, I of course have siblings and friends are, and I'll place this in the way that I've most typically heard it, but I'm sure it exists in other ways too, which is in the conversation in my head is one where a woman is saying, you know, like they're with somebody or dating somebody and like, he's so clueless.

If you are really interested in these drugs and how they work, and you'd like to get a glance at a table of all the results from all the studies of which there are now hundreds, there's an excellent review about these drugs and their use and their comparison to similarly structured drugs, in particular MDMA and cocaine and amphetamine, meaning street amphetamine, to really illustrate the similarities of action and some of the problems associated with long-term use.

And many of those compounds have been of tremendous benefit to children and even some adults who suffer from ADHD. So properly prescribed at the appropriate dosage, those compounds can really help people with clinically diagnosed ADHD. The way they help those people is a bit surprising, however.

Now, I am definitely not saying that people should come off those drugs entirely. And in fact, I want to take a really firm stand here because I know this is a bit controversial, but I'm just going to tell you, having evaluated the whole literature several times over now, I do think, I personally believe that there is a strong case for certain children and adults to take these compounds that increase dopamine and epinephrine. Yes, those compounds are different forms of amphetamine, but those compounds we know can increase neuroplasticity, the rewiring, LTP, LTD, et cetera, within the neural circuits that control focus, attention, and working memory.

That said, I think this all again speaks to the importance of arriving at minimal effective dosage. And it stands to reason that if you're somebody who's taking ADHD meds, or if your child is taking ADHD meds, that one would want to do all the other things that they could do in order to try and improve cardiovascular health, or at least not put it at additional risk.

And the cooling group basically left all other groups in the dust. It was just remarkable. So cooling the core, I want to be very clear that it's not cooling the muscle. It wasn't about cooling the chest alone or just cooling the palms. It was about allowing cold to pass through the palms because of the unique vasculature that's there, these AVAs, allowed these subjects to do far more work per unit time. And the important thing is that if they were to come back after doing 600 pull-ups or 500 pull-ups, you might say, well, wow, that's going to create a situation where recovery is going to be absolutely impossible. They could come back, not use the cooling, and they still saw a highly significant increase in the amount or the number of pull-ups or dips or bench press weight that they could do, okay?

Absolutely incredible data showing that the proper use of Palmer cooling, so the palms or the upper half of the face or the bottoms of the feet, can vastly, I mean, vastly increase the volume of exercise that one can do and still recover from that exercise and derive benefits from it.

And that is because when one engages in exercise or muscular output of any kind, strength or endurance exercise, the range of temperatures under which a muscle can perform is actually very narrow. There's an enzyme called pyruvate kinase, which is critical to muscle contractions. And pyruvate kinase can only function in a very narrow range of temperatures. If that temperature gets too hot, meaning if the muscle heats up locally, whether or not by running or cycling or swimming or weightlifting, the ability for that muscle to continue to contract is reduced and eventually is short-circuited completely. And I think this is a much under explored, or at least a much under discussed aspect of so-called muscular failure or the failure of one to continue to endure in running. So for instance, when you run as compared to a bench press or something, you don't stop running because you can't actually contract the muscles further, but somehow signals about the heating up of muscular tissue are conveyed to the brain. There's a crosstalk there.\",\n",

For instance, that cold water immersion is more likely to positively influence muscular power performance, to reduce muscle soreness, to reduce serum creatine kinase, and to improve perceived recovery after high intensity exercise as compared with passive recovery. This can be translated to cold water exposure after training is beneficial and probably better than passive recovery from a number of standpoints. In addition, they say that dose response relationships, meaning the amount and the degree of cold that people were exposed to and how often they did that, in particular in lower temperature cold immersion. So these would be the sorts of cold immersion protocols that are one minute or two minutes, three minutes, maybe five minutes, but that one couldn't stay in there longer because it feels stressful and one wants to get out, may be more effective after high intensity exercise for removal of serum creatine kinase, as well that these shorter duration cold water immersion approaches may be more effective after high intensity endurance performance as well.\",\n",

It's not quite hitting failure, but you're really pushing the system to the point where you are not ready to do another set and yet you begin another set. You're not necessarily psychologically ready. I'll talk more about some of the adaptations that this causes in terms of stroke volume in a few minutes when we talk about how it is that work of this sort can increase our heart's ability to deliver blood and oxygen to our lungs and other tissues. I'm going to get very specific about how to breathe during these different types of protocols and what's happening at the level of the heart. But I want to make sure I touch on the fourth protocol, which is high-intensity aerobic conditioning. So HIT has these two forms, anaerobic and aerobic, and you just heard about anaerobic. High-intensity aerobic conditioning also involves about three to 12 sets, starting off, of course, with fewer sets as you're getting into this training, and then extending into more sets as one parameter you could expand.\",\n",

What I've done is to select key protocols from those episodes that I myself have started to incorporate into my existing fitness routine and that I think will be especially beneficial and frankly fun for you to incorporate into your fitness routine.\",\n",

Now, because that series is so extensive in terms of its depth and breadth, again, providing so much value at zero cost, thanks to Dr. Andy Galpin's expertise, but at the same time, because it might be a little bit intimidating for many people out there to try and figure out which protocols to incorporate into their existing fitness regimen. I thought it would be fun and very beneficial to talk about some of the key tools that were described throughout that series that one could consider incorporating into their existing fitness routine now. So that's what this episode is really about. It's about the tools that I personally gleaned from those discussions and that I found to be of tremendous value in improving both my cardiovascular fitness, my strength and hypertrophy training, my recovery, and other aspects of my overall fitness protocols.\",\n",

While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like enhancing the quality and duration of sleep, for enhancing focus, and for hormone support. The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to announce that we've partnered with Momentous Supplements. We've done that for several reasons. First of all, Momentous Supplements are of the very highest quality. Second of all, they mainly focus on single ingredient formulations, which is absolutely key if you want to develop a supplement regimen that's most biologically and cost-effective. It, for instance, allows you to alternate dosages across days, to change the dosages of individual ingredients, so on and so forth. In addition, Momentous supplements ship internationally, which we know is important because many of you reside outside of the United States.

So sometimes I'm writing, but writing I think can underscore for me a desire to be compulsively productive. And I think that is inversely correlated to my happiness or sense of well-being a lot of the time. So there are many areas in my life now. So if you were to ask me what has changed significantly since the time that you wrote The 4-Hour Body, I would say that rather than looking for areas to optimize, I am looking where I can very deliberately de-optimize certain areas to increase sense of well-being. Where can I de-optimize? Where can I stop measuring? Where can I stop reading books? Which areas can I ignore completely? What types of information can I just excise from my life altogether for a period of time? Delete Twitter. Stop reading about books in X related to say AI or whatever it might be.

Those I think at the time were implanted below the skin. Nowadays, they're less invasive blood glucose monitors, things like levels and so forth. And these are actually becoming pretty popular. I've worn one of these before. They're actually pretty informative. I learned for instance, that when I go in the sauna, that I experience a sharp rise in blood glucose.

So if we know that maybe say multiple people are struggling that day, maybe we'll put on the lights extra bright. We'll bring in some extra things and just get it more light in the area. It doesn't even count actually going outside and seeing the sun, but perhaps we'll do that. And then other little tricks that I've learned over the years is one particular thing I love is literally drawing a line, a physical line on the ground. And you look at that line and you say, I'm going to train today and I'm going to accomplish this effort. I'm not going to walk past this line and into that training space until I'm ready to give that effort. And that may take a minute or 10 or whatever. But the physical barrier is very important to saying, like, I'm not just going to get through it. I'm going to actually perform the way I want to perform, or I'm not going to do it, and I'm not going to cross this line until I'm ready to make that happen.\",\n",

Dr. Professor Andy Galpin, super excited to have you here. You're such an immense treasure trove of information on physical training and optimizing for specific goals and outcomes with physical exercise. I'm curious, however, so many people have different levels of fitness. Some people are professional athletes, of course, but most people are not. Many people exercise regularly. Some people are trying to do that more. Some people are doing too much of that. They're overtraining. They're not recovering enough. If we were to take a step back and each and every one of us ask, how fit are we? With the word fit, of course, being a very broad encompassing word, you know, could encompass endurance, certainly does, strength, the ability to run fast, even if for short distances.\",\n",

He said, for instance, that for every year after age 40, there's a 1% drop in muscle size that can be offset by resistance training, but that if you don't do resistance training, that you won't offset. And during that series, we also talked about the minimum requirement for six and probably more like 10 working sets per muscle group per week in order to at least maintain muscle size, not just age 40 and beyond, but even at younger ages. Okay, so that's muscle size, 1% decrease per year, unless you do the right thing. And the right thing is get six to 10 working sets per week in order to offset that decrease.

I would encourage you to explore some of the protocols that Dr. Andy Galpin and I discussed on the exercise series that we did with Dr. Galpin. That would be largely training after a warmup, of course, in the one to three repetition range. And even some training that's done strictly for power, moving the weight quickly at loads that are substantially lighter. Although for some people, just because of their genetic makeup, they are going to react with hypertrophy to that kind of training. So I would say if you want to weight train, which is a great idea, and you don't want to put on size, but you want to get stronger, train in that one to three repetition range. Now that does not necessarily mean one repetition maximums, you know, eking out the absolute last single rep that you can with the most amount of weight.

So that's a great benefit for those of you that want to be strong and also want to maintain cardiovascular fitness, but you don't want to add muscular size. And of course, for all of you that want to add muscular size, it's well-established that increasing your strength will allow you then to return to patterns of hypertrophy training that will allow you to use heavier weights and therefore induce greater hypertrophy. So there are oh so many reasons to incorporate these strength training protocols. So the way that Dr. Andy Galpin suggested one do it, and was the way that I did it, is to use this three by five protocol. The three by five protocol is very straightforward. It involves doing three to five exercises per workout. Okay. So if it's a workout for legs, it's three to five exercises.\",\n",

Now, we haven't talked too much about melatonin, but melatonin is a hormone that is inhibited by light. It's actually prevented by light. And melatonin is the hormone that allows you to fall asleep easily. Now I'm not talking about supplementing melatonin. I'm talking about melatonin that you naturally produce from your pineal. So the protocol is very simple. Get outside in the afternoon or evening for 10 to 30 minutes, take your sunglasses off, get some bright light, get some natural light in your eyes. If you can't do that, probably better to just stay with standard artificial lights inside. Don't crank them up, but just start to dim them. Again, this would be a time to avoid blue blockers.\",\n",

So viewing bright light in the late evening hours and nighttime hours is really not good for your sleep quality and your ability to fall and stay asleep. So for most people, a simple rule of thumb is going to be avoid bright artificial lights of all colors. And in particular overhead, bright artificial lights between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. That's right, between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m., avoid those bright artificial lights as much as possible.

If you're viewing bright light in the middle of the night, you are suppressing dopamine release. If you're suppressing dopamine release, you are suppressing testosterone levels. So much so that I would wager that a major effect of sleep deprivation on reducing testosterone and estrogen is not necessarily because of the lack of sleep per se. It's because usually when people are not getting enough sleep, they're getting too much light in their eyes in the middle of the night as well. A study on this has not been completed yet, but there are two studies published in Cell and Neuron, both Cell Press journals, excellent journals, showing that viewing bright light with the eyes in the middle of the circadian night has a detrimental effect on dopamine and therefore has a detrimental effect on things like testosterone and estrogen.\",\n",

When there's a reciprocity, when the person receiving understands something about the person that's giving to them and understands that the person is giving genuinely, for instance.

They pop up really quickly when you say it's time to go for a walk. Costello does it one limb at a time, and sometimes he just goes back to sleep. And so there are people like that too. And so you have to know where you are and what particular goals you're trying to pursue.\",\n",

It kickstarts the deployment of those chemicals and those neural circuits that then allow you to be motivated for some period of time. But then that is a transient increase in autonomic arousal, which is why perhaps every 20 minutes or perhaps on the hour, you might stop, do a 30 second or 60 second visual target training, then lean back into your process of however it is that you are pursuing your goal. I should also mention that if your eyes are getting tired doing whatever goal pursuit you happen to be engaged in, it's also a good idea to go into that panoramic vision mode. The easiest way to do that is to go outside or to be outside and to view a horizon and not look at any one particular point on the horizon. But if you're indoors, as I am now, you can also just relax your eyes, you know, blinking a few times and getting rid of that virgin's eye movement and try and visualize the corners of the room or the sides of the room, rather, the floor and the ceiling all at once.\",\n",

However, right now, I just want to emphasize how the data impact my day and how I structure my day in a way that I can incorporate physical movement in a way that supports my brain and health. Basically, after I finish that cognitive work bout, that 90 minute work bout, I do some form of physical exercise for about an hour. The data all point to the fact that working out hard for longer than an hour can actually be detrimental because of the way that it raises cortisol and cortisol can be a good thing if it's appropriately timed and in the appropriate low levels, but you don't want to have your cortisol levels up throughout the day or have big spikes of cortisol repeatedly. So keeping workouts relatively short can definitely help with that. And certainly if you're training hard, 60 minutes or less should be more than sufficient.\",\n",

So first, I'm just going to tell you what I found to be the maximum amount of growth hormone release as it relates to a particular form of exercise. The particular form of exercise is either weight training or it can be endurance training, but the endurance training and the weight training actually have to be limited to about 60 minutes, not much longer. Now this is important because it's been shown over and over again that if one exercises too long with weights or endurance exercise, that cortisol levels go high enough that it starts to inhibit the testosterone and even the estrogen pathways. This is why I believe people who over-exercise or exercise a lot can lose their menstrual cycles. They stop menstruating. It's why you get suppressions in testosterone if people train too long and too hard. The cutoff has always been, you know, 60 to 75 minutes of the hard work part.\",\n",

You also need to use your minds. I'm certainly familiar with wanting to get exercise, but also the requirement of needing to perform cognitive work throughout the day. It also turns out that you can leverage something interesting about exercise and nerve to muscle work in ways that can benefit cognitive function and focus. And it has to do with the way that your body and your nervous system predict bouts of intense focused effort. So let's say you're doing resistance training two or three times a week, maybe even four times a week, and you're doing it consistently at a given time. There are clocks, literally biological clocks within the liver and within the brain that learn to predict that focus and that intense work.

There's a wonderful review that was published in 2019 in the Journal of Sport and Health Science entitled, The Compelling Link Between Physical Activity and the Body's Defense System. And there's a lot to this review article, but I'll just highlight a few of the critical features that are going to directly relate to protocols that I think all of you are going to be interested in. First of all, we know that exercise that's of 60 minutes in duration or less, and that is intense, but not all out effort. Okay.

Little note here, if you have trouble recovering from exercise or you want to continue to derive the benefits from exercise, in general, best not to do high intensity exercise for longer than 75 minutes or 90 minutes, probably being the outer threshold. I realize that there are some genetic freaks out there or people that are chemically assisted that can recover from very intense, long bouts of exercise, but most people don't do well through long bouts of intense exercise on a regular basis and limiting their intense exercise to 60 minutes or less, that doesn't include the warmup, is going to be beneficial. See the episode on Toolkit for Fitness if you'd like details on that. Exercise is known to increase levels of dopamine, cortisol, and other catecholamines and neurotransmitters very potently, and things like testosterone and estrogen in ways that we know are beneficial to us, and of course have all these positive effects on the musculoskeletal system and cardiovascular effects.\",\n",

On certain rare instances, the guy was under control, but they were almost always negative emotions. So we just assumed that it was defined to what was confined to what was driving hostage takers was negativity. Now, if I may, because I feel like an imposter talking about neuroscience to you. Your knowledge of neuroscience is spot on, Voss. I must say, numerous times you've asked me about things in neuroscience, and you've never been off the mark. Oh, thank you.

So this is important to know. If one places more specificity on negative emotions, it also can enhance one's kind of experience of those negative emotions. Now, that means that this is a two-sided blade, all right? This isn't always a good thing. And if one is thinking about protocols for improving mood and mental health, the data make very clear that adding more specificity to our positive emotions in terms of the language we use, but also just the depth with which we process and think about those positive experiences can be very beneficial for us.

If none of this makes sense right now, I promise it will make sense soon. But the important thing to understand is that emotions do arise in the brain and body. They arise because there are specific connections between specific areas in the brain and body. And if we want to understand how emotions work, we have to look how emotions are built.

You can try various other things. That's what works for me. In addition, I use low level white noise. This is something that is supported by quality peer reviewed data. We covered this on the episode on hearing and balance, but it turns out that white noise, which is essentially all frequencies of sound, or all frequencies of sound that we can perceive, mixed up kind of randomly, there's no structure to it, turned on at a low volume, not with headphones most of the time, puts the brain into a state that's optimal for learning and workflow. And I covered two papers during that episode, one that showed that indeed brain areas involved in attention, brain areas involved in focus and cognition and memory, those are engaged to a greater degree when there is low levels of white noise playing in the background. The other paper that's really interesting did brain imaging and showed that areas of the brain that are associated with dopamine release are increased by low levels of white noise.\",\n",

Dopamine is a neuromodulator, meaning it's a chemical that's released in our brain and body, but mostly in our brain, that modulates, meaning controls the likelihood that certain brain areas will be active and other brain areas won't be active. And dopamine is associated with motivation. Dopamine is associated with craving. Motivation is associated with all sorts of different things, including movement. But what this study so nicely shows is that white noise can really enhance the activity of neurons in what's called the substantia nigra VTA.

Not imperceptible, so not so quiet that you can't hear it, but not super loud either, it actually could enhance learning to a significant degree.

Dr. Gottfried points out why women have particular needs when it comes to essential fatty acids and how best to obtain those essential fatty acids for hormone health.

Now I realize that some of you are probably still asking, how can it be that stress diminishes health and performance and stress also enhances health and performance? And the answer lies in two things. One, the level of stress and therefore the level of hormones that are released in response to that stress, the duration over which the stress response occurs. But the key variable here is that our cognitive understanding about what stress does impacts whether or not our physiology goes down the direction of debilitating or enhancing effects of stress. Okay, so we've got a condition here where people are being informed very differently about what stress does. In one case, it's the stress is bad message.

Now, I am definitely not saying that people should come off those drugs entirely. And in fact, I want to take a really firm stand here because I know this is a bit controversial, but I'm just going to tell you, having evaluated the whole literature several times over now, I do think, I personally believe that there is a strong case for certain children and adults to take these compounds that increase dopamine and epinephrine.

That said, I think this all again speaks to the importance of arriving at minimal effective dosage. And it stands to reason that if you're somebody who's taking ADHD meds, or if your child is taking ADHD meds, that one would want to do all the other things that they could do in order to try and improve cardiovascular health, or at least not put it at additional risk.

And the cooling group basically left all other groups in the dust. It was just remarkable. So cooling the core, I want to be very clear that it's not cooling the muscle. It wasn't about cooling the chest alone or just cooling the palms. It was about allowing cold to pass through the palms because of the unique vasculature that's there, these AVAs, allowed these subjects to do far more work per unit time. And the important thing is that if they were to come back after doing 600 pull-ups or 500 pull-ups, you might say, well, wow, that's going to create a situation where recovery is going to be absolutely impossible. They could come back, not use the cooling, and they still saw a highly significant increase in the amount or the number of pull-ups or dips or bench press weight that they could do, okay? So what that meant is that it was both an excellent performance and an excellent training stimulus that they were able to recover from, okay?\",\n",

I don't want to go into the details now, but that episode is entitled Supercharge Your Exercise with Cold. This is based on work that was done by Craig Heller's lab at Stanford University. Absolutely incredible data showing that the proper use of Palmer cooling, so the palms or the upper half of the face or the bottoms of the feet, can vastly, I mean, vastly increase the volume of exercise that one can do and still recover from that exercise and derive benefits from it.

And that is because when one engages in exercise or muscular output of any kind, strength or endurance exercise, the range of temperatures under which a muscle can perform is actually very narrow. There's an enzyme called pyruvate kinase, which is critical to muscle contractions. And pyruvate kinase can only function in a very narrow range of temperatures. If that temperature gets too hot, meaning if the muscle heats up locally, whether or not by running or cycling or swimming or weightlifting, the ability for that muscle to continue to contract is reduced and eventually is short-circuited completely. And I think this is a much under explored, or at least a much under discussed aspect of so-called muscular failure or the failure of one to continue to endure in running. So for instance, when you run as compared to a bench press or something, you don't stop running because you can't actually contract the muscles further, but somehow signals about the heating up of muscular tissue are conveyed to the brain. There's a crosstalk there.\",\n",

For instance, that cold water immersion is more likely to positively influence muscular power performance, to reduce muscle soreness, to reduce serum creatine kinase, and to improve perceived recovery after high intensity exercise as compared with passive recovery. This can be translated to cold water exposure after training is beneficial and probably better than passive recovery from a number of standpoints. In addition, they say that dose response relationships, meaning the amount and the degree of cold that people were exposed to and how often they did that, in particular in lower temperature cold immersion. So these would be the sorts of cold immersion protocols that are one minute or two minutes, three minutes, maybe five minutes, but that one couldn't stay in there longer because it feels stressful and one wants to get out, may be more effective after high intensity exercise for removal of serum creatine kinase, as well that these shorter duration cold water immersion approaches may be more effective after high intensity endurance performance as well.\",\n",

If you can do that, the sooner you can do that after a workout, the sooner that the muscle will recover, that the tendons will recover, and that the person, you, can get back into more endurance training, more weight training, et cetera.

It's not quite hitting failure, but you're really pushing the system to the point where you are not ready to do another set and yet you begin another set. You're not necessarily psychologically ready. I'll talk more about some of the adaptations that this causes in terms of stroke volume in a few minutes when we talk about how it is that work of this sort can increase our heart's ability to deliver blood and oxygen to our lungs and other tissues. I'm going to get very specific about how to breathe during these different types of protocols and what's happening at the level of the heart. But I want to make sure I touch on the fourth protocol, which is high-intensity aerobic conditioning. So HIT has these two forms, anaerobic and aerobic, and you just heard about anaerobic. High-intensity aerobic conditioning also involves about three to 12 sets, starting off, of course, with fewer sets as you're getting into this training, and then extending into more sets as one parameter you could expand.\",\n",

That's the best way to support this podcast. On the Huberman Lab podcast, we often discuss supplements. While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like enhancing the quality and duration of sleep, for enhancing focus, and for hormone support. The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to announce that we've partnered with Momentous Supplements. We've done that for several reasons. First of all, Momentous Supplements are of the very highest quality. Second of all, they mainly focus on single ingredient formulations, which is absolutely key if you want to develop a supplement regimen that's most biologically and cost-effective. It, for instance, allows you to alternate dosages across days, to change the dosages of individual ingredients, so on and so forth. In addition, Momentous supplements ship internationally, which we know is important because many of you reside outside of the United States. If you'd like to see the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast, please go to LiveMomentous, spelled O-U-S.\",\n",

       "    'answer': \"While you're on these nature retreats, are you writing on a daily basis? Are you just thinking and allowing thoughts to enter and leave your system? Depends on the retreat. So sometimes I'm writing, but writing I think can underscore for me a desire to be compulsively productive. And I think that is inversely correlated to my happiness or sense of well-being a lot of the time. So there are many areas in my life now. So if you were to ask me what has changed significantly since the time that you wrote The 4-Hour Body, I would say that rather than looking for areas to optimize, I am looking where I can very deliberately de-optimize certain areas to increase sense of well-being. Where can I de-optimize? Where can I stop measuring? Where can I stop reading books? Which areas can I ignore completely? What types of information can I just excise from my life altogether for a period of time? Delete Twitter. Stop reading about books in X related to say AI or whatever it might be. Like where can I de-optimize selectively to sort of optimize the whole? Does that make sense? Makes good sense. Yeah.\",\n",

Now, as I mentioned earlier, Tim is known for being able to see around corners or predict the future. He really does seem to be about five, if not 10 years ahead of everybody else in thinking about tools for optimization in particular domains of life. And so we were very fortunate that during today's discussion, he shares with us his current creative endeavors and how he's thinking about and approaching those.

And he's also brought together other philanthropists, which has really galvanized the whole field of psychedelic research for the treatment of mental health, transforming it from what was recently kind of a fringe area of science to a mainstay that's actually funded not only by philanthropy, but by the National Institutes of Health.\",\n",

He talked about the fact that at least in his experiments on himself, the ingestion of vinegar did not seem to blunt blood glucose. And he was using continuous glucose monitors. These incidentally, another example of where Ferris was early to the game and the rest of us are kind of just in his wake. He talked about the use of blood glucose monitors. Those I think at the time were implanted below the skin. Nowadays, they're less invasive blood glucose monitors, things like levels and so forth. And these are actually becoming pretty popular. I've worn one of these before. They're actually pretty informative. I learned for instance, that when I go in the sauna, that I experience a sharp rise in blood glucose.

I'm curious, however, so many people have different levels of fitness. Some people are professional athletes, of course, but most people are not. Many people exercise regularly. Some people are trying to do that more. Some people are doing too much of that. They're overtraining. They're not recovering enough. If we were to take a step back and each and every one of us ask, how fit are we? With the word fit, of course, being a very broad encompassing word, you know, could encompass endurance, certainly does, strength, the ability to run fast, even if for short distances.\",\n",

So you don't need to be highly trained in order to perform them. In fact, there is a place, and we will describe, when one would want to apply dynamic or ballistic stretching. I'll just give away for now. I think that most physios out there, and certainly the ones that I spoke to, Dr. Andy Galpin, Dr. Kelly Starrett, and a few others, point to the fact that doing some safe dynamic and ballistic stretching prior to, say, a resistance training session, or maybe even prior to a cardiovascular training session can be useful, both in terms of range of motion effects and in terms of neural activation effects.\",\n",

He said, when you look at the data on aging and performance, in particular muscular performance, you see some very interesting patterns within the data. He said, for instance, that for every year after age 40, there's a 1% drop in muscle size that can be offset by resistance training, but that if you don't do resistance training, that you won't offset. And during that series, we also talked about the minimum requirement for six and probably more like 10 working sets per muscle group per week in order to at least maintain muscle size, not just age 40 and beyond, but even at younger ages. Okay, so that's muscle size, 1% decrease per year, unless you do the right thing. And the right thing is get six to 10 working sets per week in order to offset that decrease. And if you train properly for hypertrophy, yes, you can still increase muscle size past age 40.\",\n",

I would encourage you to explore some of the protocols that Dr. Andy Galpin and I discussed on the exercise series that we did with Dr. Galpin. That would be largely training after a warmup, of course, in the one to three repetition range. And even some training that's done strictly for power, moving the weight quickly at loads that are substantially lighter. Although for some people, just because of their genetic makeup, they are going to react with hypertrophy to that kind of training. So I would say if you want to weight train, which is a great idea, and you don't want to put on size, but you want to get stronger, train in that one to three repetition range. Now that does not necessarily mean one repetition maximums, you know, eking out the absolute last single rep that you can with the most amount of weight. Maybe you back off on your single repetition maximum, you're still just doing one repetition.\",\n",

So that's a great benefit for those of you that want to be strong and also want to maintain cardiovascular fitness, but you don't want to add muscular size. And of course, for all of you that want to add muscular size, it's well-established that increasing your strength will allow you then to return to patterns of hypertrophy training that will allow you to use heavier weights and therefore induce greater hypertrophy. So there are oh so many reasons to incorporate these strength training protocols. So the way that Dr. Andy Galpin suggested one do it, and was the way that I did it, is to use this three by five protocol. The three by five protocol is very straightforward. It involves doing three to five exercises per workout. Okay. So if it's a workout for legs, it's three to five exercises.\",\n",

Now, we haven't talked too much about melatonin, but melatonin is a hormone that is inhibited by light. It's actually prevented by light. And melatonin is the hormone that allows you to fall asleep easily. Now I'm not talking about supplementing melatonin. I'm talking about melatonin that you naturally produce from your pineal. So the protocol is very simple. Get outside in the afternoon or evening for 10 to 30 minutes, take your sunglasses off, get some bright light, get some natural light in your eyes. If you can't do that, probably better to just stay with standard artificial lights inside. Don't crank them up, but just start to dim them. Again, this would be a time to avoid blue blockers.\",\n",

Now melatonin, a lot of people think of as a supplement, but melatonin is naturally released as the evening comes about and into the nighttime hours, it's a hormone that makes you feel sleepy and allows you to fall asleep. So viewing bright light in the late evening hours and nighttime hours is really not good for your sleep quality and your ability to fall and stay asleep. So for most people, a simple rule of thumb is going to be avoid bright artificial lights of all colors. And in particular overhead, bright artificial lights between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. That's right, between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m., avoid those bright artificial lights as much as possible.

The other aspect of light viewing behavior that's extremely important is to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes in the middle of the night. If you're viewing bright light in the middle of the night, you are suppressing dopamine release. If you're suppressing dopamine release, you are suppressing testosterone levels. So much so that I would wager that a major effect of sleep deprivation on reducing testosterone and estrogen is not necessarily because of the lack of sleep per se. It's because usually when people are not getting enough sleep, they're getting too much light in their eyes in the middle of the night as well. A study on this has not been completed yet, but there are two studies published in Cell and Neuron, both Cell Press journals, excellent journals, showing that viewing bright light with the eyes in the middle of the circadian night has a detrimental effect on dopamine and therefore has a detrimental effect on things like testosterone and estrogen.\",\n",

But if you're indoors, as I am now, you can also just relax your eyes, you know, blinking a few times and getting rid of that virgin's eye movement and try and visualize the corners of the room or the sides of the room, rather, the floor and the ceiling all at once.\",\n",

However, right now, I just want to emphasize how the data impact my day and how I structure my day in a way that I can incorporate physical movement in a way that supports my brain and health. Basically, after I finish that cognitive work bout, that 90 minute work bout, I do some form of physical exercise for about an hour. The data all point to the fact that working out hard for longer than an hour can actually be detrimental because of the way that it raises cortisol and cortisol can be a good thing if it's appropriately timed and in the appropriate low levels, but you don't want to have your cortisol levels up throughout the day or have big spikes of cortisol repeatedly. So keeping workouts relatively short can definitely help with that. And certainly if you're training hard, 60 minutes or less should be more than sufficient.\",\n",

So first, I'm just going to tell you what I found to be the maximum amount of growth hormone release as it relates to a particular form of exercise. The particular form of exercise is either weight training or it can be endurance training, but the endurance training and the weight training actually have to be limited to about 60 minutes, not much longer. Now this is important because it's been shown over and over again that if one exercises too long with weights or endurance exercise, that cortisol levels go high enough that it starts to inhibit the testosterone and even the estrogen pathways. This is why I believe people who over-exercise or exercise a lot can lose their menstrual cycles. They stop menstruating. It's why you get suppressions in testosterone if people train too long and too hard. The cutoff has always been, you know, 60 to 75 minutes of the hard work part.\",\n",

You also need to use your minds. I'm certainly familiar with wanting to get exercise, but also the requirement of needing to perform cognitive work throughout the day. It also turns out that you can leverage something interesting about exercise and nerve to muscle work in ways that can benefit cognitive function and focus. And it has to do with the way that your body and your nervous system predict bouts of intense focused effort. So let's say you're doing resistance training two or three times a week, maybe even four times a week, and you're doing it consistently at a given time. There are clocks, literally biological clocks within the liver and within the brain that learn to predict that focus and that intense work.

Little note here, if you have trouble recovering from exercise or you want to continue to derive the benefits from exercise, in general, best not to do high intensity exercise for longer than 75 minutes or 90 minutes, probably being the outer threshold. I realize that there are some genetic freaks out there or people that are chemically assisted that can recover from very intense, long bouts of exercise, but most people don't do well through long bouts of intense exercise on a regular basis and limiting their intense exercise to 60 minutes or less, that doesn't include the warmup, is going to be beneficial. See the episode on Toolkit for Fitness if you'd like details on that. Exercise is known to increase levels of dopamine, cortisol, and other catecholamines and neurotransmitters very potently, and things like testosterone and estrogen in ways that we know are beneficial to us, and of course have all these positive effects on the musculoskeletal system and cardiovascular effects.\",\n",

I'm really trying to get people out of the notion of active listening just because active listening has been so overused that people have lost track of it and most of it is taught poorly and it's interactive or it's proactive. And so we learned as hostage negotiators, first of all, just to label the presenting emotion. And we just assumed that, and the presenting emotion was always anger of some form, anger, upset. On certain rare instances, the guy was under control, but they were almost always negative emotions. So we just assumed that it was defined to what was confined to what was driving hostage takers was negativity. Now, if I may, because I feel like an imposter talking about neuroscience to you. Your knowledge of neuroscience is spot on, Voss. I must say, numerous times you've asked me about things in neuroscience, and you've never been off the mark. Oh, thank you.

If none of this makes sense right now, I promise it will make sense soon. But the important thing to understand is that emotions do arise in the brain and body. They arise because there are specific connections between specific areas in the brain and body. And if we want to understand how emotions work, we have to look how emotions are built.

You can try various other things. That's what works for me. In addition, I use low level white noise. This is something that is supported by quality peer reviewed data. We covered this on the episode on hearing and balance, but it turns out that white noise, which is essentially all frequencies of sound, or all frequencies of sound that we can perceive, mixed up kind of randomly, there's no structure to it, turned on at a low volume, not with headphones most of the time, puts the brain into a state that's optimal for learning and workflow. And I covered two papers during that episode, one that showed that indeed brain areas involved in attention, brain areas involved in focus and cognition and memory, those are engaged to a greater degree when there is low levels of white noise playing in the background. The other paper that's really interesting did brain imaging and showed that areas of the brain that are associated with dopamine release are increased by low levels of white noise.\",\n",

Now I don't expect you to know what the right superior temporal sulcus is.

Dopamine is a neuromodulator, meaning it's a chemical that's released in our brain and body, but mostly in our brain, that modulates, meaning controls the likelihood that certain brain areas will be active and other brain areas won't be active. And dopamine is associated with motivation. Dopamine is associated with craving. Motivation is associated with all sorts of different things, including movement. But what this study so nicely shows is that white noise can really enhance the activity of neurons in what's called the substantia nigra VTA.

Not imperceptible, so not so quiet that you can't hear it, but not super loud either, it actually could enhance learning to a significant degree.

Now I realize that some of you are probably still asking, how can it be that stress diminishes health and performance and stress also enhances health and performance? And the answer lies in two things. One, the level of stress and therefore the level of hormones that are released in response to that stress, the duration over which the stress response occurs. But the key variable here is that our cognitive understanding about what stress does impacts whether or not our physiology goes down the direction of debilitating or enhancing effects of stress. Okay, so we've got a condition here where people are being informed very differently about what stress does. In one case, it's the stress is bad message.

And that is because when one engages in exercise or muscular output of any kind, strength or endurance exercise, the range of temperatures under which a muscle can perform is actually very narrow. There's an enzyme called pyruvate kinase, which is critical to muscle contractions. And pyruvate kinase can only function in a very narrow range of temperatures. If that temperature gets too hot, meaning if the muscle heats up locally, whether or not by running or cycling or swimming or weightlifting, the ability for that muscle to continue to contract is reduced and eventually is short-circuited completely. And I think this is a much under explored, or at least a much under discussed aspect of so-called muscular failure or the failure of one to continue to endure in running. So for instance, when you run as compared to a bench press or something, you don't stop running because you can't actually contract the muscles further, but somehow signals about the heating up of muscular tissue are conveyed to the brain.

This can be translated to cold water exposure after training is beneficial and probably better than passive recovery from a number of standpoints. In addition, they say that dose response relationships, meaning the amount and the degree of cold that people were exposed to and how often they did that, in particular in lower temperature cold immersion. So these would be the sorts of cold immersion protocols that are one minute or two minutes, three minutes, maybe five minutes, but that one couldn't stay in there longer because it feels stressful and one wants to get out, may be more effective after high intensity exercise for removal of serum creatine kinase, as well that these shorter duration cold water immersion approaches may be more effective after high intensity endurance performance as well.\",\n",

High-intensity aerobic conditioning also involves about three to 12 sets, starting off, of course, with fewer sets as you're getting into this training, and then extending into more sets as one parameter you could expand.\",\n",

This has been supported by many, many quality peer reviewed studies. So that's one form of positive adaptation. I also talked about just sort of performance adaptations, how doing high intensity aerobic conditioning of the mile repeats type training can actually improve your ability to do long bouts of intense work. It also seems like it dovetails or is compatible with resistance training that's aimed towards strength and hypertrophy. Now in full disclosure, the data seemed to indicate that if people just weight train or train for strength, so three reps, rest five minutes, three reps of heavy weights, et cetera, yeah, you'll get much stronger than you would if you're doing things like, you know, five repetitions up to 12 or 12 to 25 reps and you're, you know, and you're going out for long jogs.

Because many people who, for instance, have excessive levels of anxiety, have excessive levels of anxiety because they are very keenly aware of any subtle shift in their heart rate or breathing or change in the sensations within their stomach.

And again, this brings us back to this alertness, calmness axis, and this interoceptive, exteroceptive axis. In order to form good bonds, we can't just be thinking about how we feel. We also need to be paying attention to how others feel, and we're evaluating a match. We're trying to see whether or not there seems to be some sort of synchrony between states.

And the findings were essentially that there's no difference, that people with ADHD, children and adults, they are aware of what's going on inside them just as much as anyone else is. And the typical measure of interoceptive awareness is one's ability to count their own heartbeats. This is actually challenging for some individuals and very easy for other individuals, regardless of their attentional capacity. Some people just can really feel their heartbeat without taking their pulse. Other people cannot. And these studies are pretty straightforward to do. You ask people to sit there and to count their heartbeats, and then you are monitoring their heartbeats and you get to gauge how accurate they are.

And of course, he teaches you how to do it. He will tell you the exact questions that you should ask and that you should answer and how to step back and think about those questions and then prioritize so that you can decide how to best invest your time. I'm sure many of you are familiar with The Tim Ferriss Show. However, if you're not already subscribing to The Tim Ferriss Show, I highly recommend you do. I still go back and listen to early episodes of The Tim Ferriss Show, and I'm a weekly listener to the new episodes. We provide a link to The Tim Ferriss Show in the show note captions. Also in the show note captions, you'll find links to Tim's many New York Times bestselling books and a link to his excellent weekly blog.

I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and reach your health goals. I've long been a fan of getting blood work done for the simple reason that many of the things that impact our immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. And now with the advent of modern DNA tests, we can also get insight into things like metabolic factors that tell us whether or not we metabolize caffeine well or certain proteins well, what our fat metabolism genes are like. Things of that sort can only be analyzed from quality blood and DNA tests.\",\n",

And during that series, we also talked about the minimum requirement for six and probably more like 10 working sets per muscle group per week in order to at least maintain muscle size, not just age 40 and beyond, but even at younger ages.

That would be largely training after a warmup, of course, in the one to three repetition range.

Now, we haven't talked too much about melatonin, but melatonin is a hormone that is inhibited by light. It's actually prevented by light. And melatonin is the hormone that allows you to fall asleep easily. Now I'm not talking about supplementing melatonin. I'm talking about melatonin that you naturally produce from your pineal. So the protocol is very simple. Get outside in the afternoon or evening for 10 to 30 minutes, take your sunglasses off, get some bright light, get some natural light in your eyes. If you can't do that, probably better to just stay with standard artificial lights inside. Don't crank them up, but just start to dim them. Again, this would be a time to avoid blue blockers.\",\n",

Now melatonin, a lot of people think of as a supplement, but melatonin is naturally released as the evening comes about and into the nighttime hours, it's a hormone that makes you feel sleepy and allows you to fall asleep. So viewing bright light in the late evening hours and nighttime hours is really not good for your sleep quality and your ability to fall and stay asleep. So for most people, a simple rule of thumb is going to be avoid bright artificial lights of all colors. And in particular overhead, bright artificial lights between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. That's right, between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m., avoid those bright artificial lights as much as possible.

The other aspect of light viewing behavior that's extremely important is to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes in the middle of the night. If you're viewing bright light in the middle of the night, you are suppressing dopamine release. If you're suppressing dopamine release, you are suppressing testosterone levels. So much so that I would wager that a major effect of sleep deprivation on reducing testosterone and estrogen is not necessarily because of the lack of sleep per se. It's because usually when people are not getting enough sleep, they're getting too much light in their eyes in the middle of the night as well. A study on this has not been completed yet, but there are two studies published in Cell and Neuron, both Cell Press journals, excellent journals, showing that viewing bright light with the eyes in the middle of the circadian night has a detrimental effect on dopamine and therefore has a detrimental effect on things like testosterone and estrogen.\",\n",

They're mentalizing, right? They're thinking about each other's emotional states and they're coming at each other through agency and gratitude. Like, I'm so grateful for you. The example is these people are partners and they're happy with their partnership. Like, oh my God, I'm so grateful I found you. They would each feel that way. I'm so grateful you're in my life.

So on the face of it, you might think, okay, if I express gratitude for somebody over and over, over and over, over and over, then I'm going to feel better about that person. And indeed that is one effect of a gratitude practice that's called a pro-social or inter-social gratitude practice. But there are now several studies, recent studies in good journals pointing to the fact that a regular gratitude practice can also enhance one's social relationships across the board, in the workplace, at school, with family, in romantic relationships, and even one's relationship to themselves, which is really what the subjective feelings of wellbeing are. So it's clear to me that an effective gratitude practice has an outsized effect on many, many aspects of mental and physical health.\",\n",

And there we go back to the important work of the great Antonio Damasio, who explored these neural correlates of gratitude to define the areas of the brain that are associated with pro-social behaviors like the prefrontal cortex. And what's really interesting about the work that Damasio and colleagues did is, first of all, they used functional magnetic resonance imaging.

Bigger increases in happiness and feelings of wellbeing and indeed neurochemicals and activation of brain areas associated with happiness and wellbeing. When there's a reciprocity, when the person receiving understands something about the person that's giving to them and understands that the person is giving genuinely, for instance. So there's an environmental interaction. It's not just about receiving, it's receiving from somebody that you know genuinely wants to give. And likewise for the giver in that equation, the feelings of wellbeing are far greater when the person receiving whatever it is, money, food, assistance in some form or another, it could be physical assistance, et cetera. When the giver has knowledge that the person receiving it genuinely needed the thing that they are receiving.

And some people are just calmer and have a harder time getting into action and an activity. It's just the way that we're wired. Some of us have autonomic nervous systems that are more geared towards parasympathetic calm states. One of the reasons I love bulldogs, not just my bulldog, is that they are very calm animals. In fact, they make no spontaneous movements unless there's something to respond to. And I find that incredibly relaxing. Other animals like pit bulls, who I also really like and enjoy, and other species, their tail's always wagging and that they're always in a position to make a movement at any second because they tend to ride at pretty high levels of autonomic arousal. They pop up really quickly when you say it's time to go for a walk. Costello does it one limb at a time, and sometimes he just goes back to sleep. And so there are people like that too.

I should also mention that if your eyes are getting tired doing whatever goal pursuit you happen to be engaged in, it's also a good idea to go into that panoramic vision mode. The easiest way to do that is to go outside or to be outside and to view a horizon and not look at any one particular point on the horizon. But if you're indoors, as I am now, you can also just relax your eyes, you know, blinking a few times and getting rid of that virgin's eye movement and try and visualize the corners of the room or the sides of the room, rather, the floor and the ceiling all at once.\",\n",

And a great night's sleep makes it a lot easier to learn, right? So what are the data in terms of the relationship between sleep and learning? Again, something we're going to go into in quite a bit more detail, but can you give us a, can you throw us a bone about some of that? Can you incentivize us for getting good sleep, not just through fear, but we heard the sticks, you know, throw us a carrot. Yeah. So there are so many wonderful carrots. So when you are sleeping, your brain's capacity and its learning centers are so much more ready to absorb information. So think about these memory centers in the brain, almost like a dry sponge if you've been sleeping well, and they are so excited to soak up new information and retain that information.\",\n",

Put simply, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep throughout the night, your body temperature has to drop by about one to three degrees. And waking up, conversely, involves your body temperature increasing by about one to three degrees. Now, people vary in their core body temperature and whether or not they tend to run hot or cold throughout the night, but with eight sleep mattresses and mattress covers, you can literally program in the exact temperature that you want to sleep in. And that allows you to fall deeply asleep, go into slow wave sleep and REM sleep, that is rapid eye movement sleep, in the exact sequence that you need to in order to have the best quality sleep, and it will even track your sleep for you. I've been sleeping with an eight sleep mattress cover on my mattress for about eight months now, and it is incredible. My sleep was already pretty good, and now it is fantastic, and I feel so much more alert and focused. My mood is far better throughout the day.\",\n",

So if you're interested in the specifics of those protocols, please see those episodes. However, right now, I just want to emphasize how the data impact my day and how I structure my day in a way that I can incorporate physical movement in a way that supports my brain and health. Basically, after I finish that cognitive work bout, that 90 minute work bout, I do some form of physical exercise for about an hour. The data all point to the fact that working out hard for longer than an hour can actually be detrimental because of the way that it raises cortisol and cortisol can be a good thing if it's appropriately timed and in the appropriate low levels, but you don't want to have your cortisol levels up throughout the day or have big spikes of cortisol repeatedly. So keeping workouts relatively short can definitely help with that. And certainly if you're training hard, 60 minutes or less should be more than sufficient.\",\n",

And the conclusion that one takes away from all of these is that exercise has to be of particular duration and intensity in order to get growth hormone release. So first, I'm just going to tell you what I found to be the maximum amount of growth hormone release as it relates to a particular form of exercise. The particular form of exercise is either weight training or it can be endurance training, but the endurance training and the weight training actually have to be limited to about 60 minutes, not much longer. Now this is important because it's been shown over and over again that if one exercises too long with weights or endurance exercise, that cortisol levels go high enough that it starts to inhibit the testosterone and even the estrogen pathways. This is why I believe people who over-exercise or exercise a lot can lose their menstrual cycles. They stop menstruating. It's why you get suppressions in testosterone if people train too long and too hard. The cutoff has always been, you know, 60 to 75 minutes of the hard work part.\",\n",

You also need to use your minds. I'm certainly familiar with wanting to get exercise, but also the requirement of needing to perform cognitive work throughout the day. It also turns out that you can leverage something interesting about exercise and nerve to muscle work in ways that can benefit cognitive function and focus. And it has to do with the way that your body and your nervous system predict bouts of intense focused effort. So let's say you're doing resistance training two or three times a week, maybe even four times a week, and you're doing it consistently at a given time. There are clocks, literally biological clocks within the liver and within the brain that learn to predict that focus and that intense work. If you are trying to get intense cognitive work done, you might try scheduling that cognitive work on the days when you don't do physical training at the same time when you normally would do that intense focused physical training.\",\n",

Little note here, if you have trouble recovering from exercise or you want to continue to derive the benefits from exercise, in general, best not to do high intensity exercise for longer than 75 minutes or 90 minutes, probably being the outer threshold. I realize that there are some genetic freaks out there or people that are chemically assisted that can recover from very intense, long bouts of exercise, but most people don't do well through long bouts of intense exercise on a regular basis and limiting their intense exercise to 60 minutes or less, that doesn't include the warmup, is going to be beneficial.

This is a study that explored whether or not learning could be enhanced by playing white noise in the background. But the strength of the study is that they looked at some of the underlying neural circuitry and the activation of the neural circuitry in these people as they did the learning task. And what it essentially illustrates is that white noise, provided that white noise is of low enough intensity, meaning not super loud, right? Not imperceptible, so not so quiet that you can't hear it, but not super loud either, it actually could enhance learning to a significant degree. And this has been shown now for a huge number of different types of learning. There's a terrific article as well as in a somewhat obscure journal, at least obscure to me, which is the effects of noise exposure on cognitive performance and brain activity patterns. That's a study involving 54 subjects. They basically were evaluated for mental workload and attention under different levels of noise exposure, background noise, and different essentially loudness of noise.\",\n",

So we really have to be careful about long-term exposure, extended exposure to white noise or kind of air conditioning noise that's really at a high level. I wouldn't worry if it's in the background and it's shutting off and turning on again as the thermostat kicks off and on, but really try and avoid work in loud fan filled or ventilation generating or heat generating environments, because it really can cause damage to the auditory system long-term. And as we described, it can impair cognitive performance and overall increased fatigue. I think we've all experienced that when you're in a room and there's some ongoing background noise and all of a sudden it stops and you just feel this enormous relief. And the reason for this is that our auditory system has a parallel to our visual system.\",\n",

Well, there's actually a quite good literature on this as well, but not so much as it relates to binaural beats, but rather whether or not people are listening to music, so-called white noise, brown noise, believe it or not, there's white noise and there's brown noise, there's even pink noise, and how that impacts brain states that allow us to learn information better or not. So now I'd like to talk about white noise. And I want to be very clear that white noise has been shown to really enhance brain states for learning in certain individuals, in particular in adults, but white noise actually can have a detrimental effect on auditory learning and maybe even the development of the auditory system in very young children, in particular in infants.

We talk about the selection of a life partner, as well as romantic and other types of relationships. We also discuss the topics of motivation and urgency, and this concept of death ground, which arose during our discussion of Robert's recent stroke. Robert's stroke rendered him certain limitations, but also has allowed him to explore how to write, how to exercise, indeed, how to interface with life in general in new ways that allow him to continue to expand his sense of purpose. I'm certain that by the end of today's episode, you will have gleaned tremendous amounts of new knowledge that will allow you to navigate forward along the path to your purpose, perhaps find your purpose if you feel you haven't done that yet, as well as to greatly enhance your relationship with yourself, with others, and indeed to the world around you. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public.\",\n",

If my heart rate goes very, very high during exercise and I do that fairly consistently or even semi-consistently, my resting heart rate will actually be quite a bit lower. That's a fantastic example. Really what you're getting at here is this concept where I think it's important to differentiate between adaptation and optimization.

It wasn't about cooling the chest alone or just cooling the palms. It was about allowing cold to pass through the palms because of the unique vasculature that's there, these AVAs, allowed these subjects to do far more work per unit time. And the important thing is that if they were to come back after doing 600 pull-ups or 500 pull-ups, you might say, well, wow, that's going to create a situation where recovery is going to be absolutely impossible. They could come back, not use the cooling, and they still saw a highly significant increase in the amount or the number of pull-ups or dips or bench press weight that they could do, okay?

And that is because when one engages in exercise or muscular output of any kind, strength or endurance exercise, the range of temperatures under which a muscle can perform is actually very narrow. There's an enzyme called pyruvate kinase, which is critical to muscle contractions. And pyruvate kinase can only function in a very narrow range of temperatures. If that temperature gets too hot, meaning if the muscle heats up locally, whether or not by running or cycling or swimming or weightlifting, the ability for that muscle to continue to contract is reduced and eventually is short-circuited completely. And I think this is a much under explored, or at least a much under discussed aspect of so-called muscular failure or the failure of one to continue to endure in running. So for instance, when you run as compared to a bench press or something, you don't stop running because you can't actually contract the muscles further, but somehow signals about the heating up of muscular tissue are conveyed to the brain. There's a crosstalk there.\",\n",

This can be translated to cold water exposure after training is beneficial and probably better than passive recovery from a number of standpoints. In addition, they say that dose response relationships, meaning the amount and the degree of cold that people were exposed to and how often they did that, in particular in lower temperature cold immersion. So these would be the sorts of cold immersion protocols that are one minute or two minutes, three minutes, maybe five minutes, but that one couldn't stay in there longer because it feels stressful and one wants to get out, may be more effective after high intensity exercise for removal of serum creatine kinase, as well that these shorter duration cold water immersion approaches may be more effective after high intensity endurance performance as well.\",\n",

I'm going to get very specific about how to breathe during these different types of protocols and what's happening at the level of the heart. But I want to make sure I touch on the fourth protocol, which is high-intensity aerobic conditioning. So HIT has these two forms, anaerobic and aerobic, and you just heard about anaerobic.

And the typical measure of interoceptive awareness is one's ability to count their own heartbeats. This is actually challenging for some individuals and very easy for other individuals, regardless of their attentional capacity. Some people just can really feel their heartbeat without taking their pulse. Other people cannot. And these studies are pretty straightforward to do. You ask people to sit there and to count their heartbeats, and then you are monitoring their heartbeats and you get to gauge how accurate they are. So it's important to understand that people with ADHD are in touch with how they feel.\",\n",

And that is, I take the stance that behavioral tools, that is specific actions that we take and specific actions that we avoid, form the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. So things like viewing morning sunlight and exercise are behavioral tools. They don't require the ingestion of anything. Within the realm of behavioral tools, there are also some don'ts or do nots that can greatly enhance our mental health, physical health, and performance, such as avoiding bright light exposure to your eyes between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.\",\n",

Most all of the tools we are going to discuss today were gleaned from the six episodes that we did with Dr. Andy Galpin. We provide a link to those full episodes in the show note captions, of course. Now, those episodes included a very large number of protocols, everything from how to build a fitness routine, how to enhance recovery, nutrition and supplementation, exercises and routines aimed specifically at strength or hypertrophy or endurance or building anaerobic capacity.

So if you were to ask me what has changed significantly since the time that you wrote The 4-Hour Body, I would say that rather than looking for areas to optimize, I am looking where I can very deliberately de-optimize certain areas to increase sense of well-being. Where can I de-optimize? Where can I stop measuring? Where can I stop reading books? Which areas can I ignore completely? What types of information can I just excise from my life altogether for a period of time? Delete Twitter. Stop reading about books in X related to say AI or whatever it might be.

These incidentally, another example of where Ferris was early to the game and the rest of us are kind of just in his wake. He talked about the use of blood glucose monitors. Those I think at the time were implanted below the skin. Nowadays, they're less invasive blood glucose monitors, things like levels and so forth. And these are actually becoming pretty popular.

And during that series, we also talked about the minimum requirement for six and probably more like 10 working sets per muscle group per week in order to at least maintain muscle size, not just age 40 and beyond, but even at younger ages. Okay, so that's muscle size, 1% decrease per year, unless you do the right thing. And the right thing is get six to 10 working sets per week in order to offset that decrease.

Now, we haven't talked too much about melatonin, but melatonin is a hormone that is inhibited by light. It's actually prevented by light. And melatonin is the hormone that allows you to fall asleep easily. Now I'm not talking about supplementing melatonin. I'm talking about melatonin that you naturally produce from your pineal. So the protocol is very simple. Get outside in the afternoon or evening for 10 to 30 minutes, take your sunglasses off, get some bright light, get some natural light in your eyes. If you can't do that, probably better to just stay with standard artificial lights inside. Don't crank them up, but just start to dim them. Again, this would be a time to avoid blue blockers.\",\n",

So viewing bright light in the late evening hours and nighttime hours is really not good for your sleep quality and your ability to fall and stay asleep. So for most people, a simple rule of thumb is going to be avoid bright artificial lights of all colors. And in particular overhead, bright artificial lights between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. That's right, between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m., avoid those bright artificial lights as much as possible.

The other aspect of light viewing behavior that's extremely important is to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes in the middle of the night. If you're viewing bright light in the middle of the night, you are suppressing dopamine release. If you're suppressing dopamine release, you are suppressing testosterone levels. So much so that I would wager that a major effect of sleep deprivation on reducing testosterone and estrogen is not necessarily because of the lack of sleep per se. It's because usually when people are not getting enough sleep, they're getting too much light in their eyes in the middle of the night as well. A study on this has not been completed yet, but there are two studies published in Cell and Neuron, both Cell Press journals, excellent journals, showing that viewing bright light with the eyes in the middle of the circadian night has a detrimental effect on dopamine and therefore has a detrimental effect on things like testosterone and estrogen.\",\n",

When the giver has knowledge that the person receiving it genuinely needed the thing that they are receiving. So the important finding within the research again and again is that happiness doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's partially our own responsibility to synthesize happiness. And I was told that many times in your life, happiness is in your head.\",\n",

Across the board, those increase the potency of the gratitude practice of listing things out on paper or in one's mind or saying them out loud. But somewhat surprisingly, at least to me, that form of just expressing thanks, expressing gratitude is not the most effective way to shift these pro-social circuits in positive ways for one's physiology and anatomy and psychology. It turns out that the most potent form of gratitude practice is not a gratitude practice where you give gratitude or express gratitude, but rather where you receive gratitude, where you receive thanks. And this to me was very surprising. There are a number of studies about this now. One in particular that I think is interesting is called prefrontal activation while listening to a letter of gratitude read aloud by a coworker face-to-face, a NIRS study, N-I-R-S. I'll explain what all this means. You now know what the prefrontal activation part is. This is activation of the prefrontal cortex. The NIRS, N-I-R-S study, that's just a technical term.

In part, we're doing this because of the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday, which of course is all about giving thanks, gratitude, but also because there's now a wealth of data showing that having an effective gratitude practice can impact a huge number of health variables, both mental health and physical health in positive ways. Things like cardiovascular health, things like relationships, things like mental health, things like physical and cognitive performance. And these are not small effects. These are very large positive effects. However, in researching this episode, I was completely surprised as to what constitutes an effective gratitude practice. I think like many of you would have thought that an effective gratitude practice simply involves writing down a few things or many things that we're grateful for, or thinking about those, or really making an effort to somaticize or feel some of the elements of gratitude while writing out that list or thinking about that list.\",\n",

And some people are just calmer and have a harder time getting into action and an activity. It's just the way that we're wired. Some of us have autonomic nervous systems that are more geared towards parasympathetic calm states. One of the reasons I love bulldogs, not just my bulldog, is that they are very calm animals. In fact, they make no spontaneous movements unless there's something to respond to. And I find that incredibly relaxing. Other animals like pit bulls, who I also really like and enjoy, and other species, their tail's always wagging and that they're always in a position to make a movement at any second because they tend to ride at pretty high levels of autonomic arousal. They pop up really quickly when you say it's time to go for a walk. Costello does it one limb at a time, and sometimes he just goes back to sleep. And so there are people like that too.

It kickstarts the deployment of those chemicals and those neural circuits that then allow you to be motivated for some period of time. But then that is a transient increase in autonomic arousal, which is why perhaps every 20 minutes or perhaps on the hour, you might stop, do a 30 second or 60 second visual target training, then lean back into your process of however it is that you are pursuing your goal. I should also mention that if your eyes are getting tired doing whatever goal pursuit you happen to be engaged in, it's also a good idea to go into that panoramic vision mode. The easiest way to do that is to go outside or to be outside and to view a horizon and not look at any one particular point on the horizon. But if you're indoors, as I am now, you can also just relax your eyes, you know, blinking a few times and getting rid of that virgin's eye movement and try and visualize the corners of the room or the sides of the room, rather, the floor and the ceiling all at once.\",\n",

But neither is the case. Again, set goals that are difficult to achieve, but that are not so lofty that they collapse your system and that you feel overwhelmed. And the important thing here is that how we perceive a goal, whether or not we think it's within reach or not, of course will vary depending on whether or not we are rested, depending on whether or not other aspects of our life are going well.

When we're in sleep, these DPOs, duration, path, and outcome analysis are impossible. We just can't do that. We are only in relation to what's happening inside of us. So sleep is key.

Basically, after I finish that cognitive work bout, that 90 minute work bout, I do some form of physical exercise for about an hour. The data all point to the fact that working out hard for longer than an hour can actually be detrimental because of the way that it raises cortisol and cortisol can be a good thing if it's appropriately timed and in the appropriate low levels, but you don't want to have your cortisol levels up throughout the day or have big spikes of cortisol repeatedly.

And the conclusion that one takes away from all of these is that exercise has to be of particular duration and intensity in order to get growth hormone release. So first, I'm just going to tell you what I found to be the maximum amount of growth hormone release as it relates to a particular form of exercise. The particular form of exercise is either weight training or it can be endurance training, but the endurance training and the weight training actually have to be limited to about 60 minutes, not much longer. Now this is important because it's been shown over and over again that if one exercises too long with weights or endurance exercise, that cortisol levels go high enough that it starts to inhibit the testosterone and even the estrogen pathways. This is why I believe people who over-exercise or exercise a lot can lose their menstrual cycles. They stop menstruating. It's why you get suppressions in testosterone if people train too long and too hard. The cutoff has always been, you know, 60 to 75 minutes of the hard work part.\",\n",

You also need to use your minds. I'm certainly familiar with wanting to get exercise, but also the requirement of needing to perform cognitive work throughout the day. It also turns out that you can leverage something interesting about exercise and nerve to muscle work in ways that can benefit cognitive function and focus. And it has to do with the way that your body and your nervous system predict bouts of intense focused effort. So let's say you're doing resistance training two or three times a week, maybe even four times a week, and you're doing it consistently at a given time. There are clocks, literally biological clocks within the liver and within the brain that learn to predict that focus and that intense work. If you are trying to get intense cognitive work done, you might try scheduling that cognitive work on the days when you don't do physical training at the same time when you normally would do that intense focused physical training.\",\n",

Little note here, if you have trouble recovering from exercise or you want to continue to derive the benefits from exercise, in general, best not to do high intensity exercise for longer than 75 minutes or 90 minutes, probably being the outer threshold. I realize that there are some genetic freaks out there or people that are chemically assisted that can recover from very intense, long bouts of exercise, but most people don't do well through long bouts of intense exercise on a regular basis and limiting their intense exercise to 60 minutes or less, that doesn't include the warmup, is going to be beneficial. See the episode on Toolkit for Fitness if you'd like details on that.

If none of this makes sense right now, I promise it will make sense soon. But the important thing to understand is that emotions do arise in the brain and body. They arise because there are specific connections between specific areas in the brain and body. And if we want to understand how emotions work, we have to look how emotions are built.

And I covered two papers during that episode, one that showed that indeed brain areas involved in attention, brain areas involved in focus and cognition and memory, those are engaged to a greater degree when there is low levels of white noise playing in the background.

And the answer lies in two things. One, the level of stress and therefore the level of hormones that are released in response to that stress, the duration over which the stress response occurs. But the key variable here is that our cognitive understanding about what stress does impacts whether or not our physiology goes down the direction of debilitating or enhancing effects of stress.

Now, I am definitely not saying that people should come off those drugs entirely. And in fact, I want to take a really firm stand here because I know this is a bit controversial, but I'm just going to tell you, having evaluated the whole literature several times over now, I do think, I personally believe that there is a strong case for certain children and adults to take these compounds that increase dopamine and epinephrine.

That said, I think this all again speaks to the importance of arriving at minimal effective dosage. And it stands to reason that if you're somebody who's taking ADHD meds, or if your child is taking ADHD meds, that one would want to do all the other things that they could do in order to try and improve cardiovascular health, or at least not put it at additional risk.

There's an enzyme called pyruvate kinase, which is critical to muscle contractions. And pyruvate kinase can only function in a very narrow range of temperatures. If that temperature gets too hot, meaning if the muscle heats up locally, whether or not by running or cycling or swimming or weightlifting, the ability for that muscle to continue to contract is reduced and eventually is short-circuited completely. And I think this is a much under explored, or at least a much under discussed aspect of so-called muscular failure or the failure of one to continue to endure in running. So for instance, when you run as compared to a bench press or something, you don't stop running because you can't actually contract the muscles further, but somehow signals about the heating up of muscular tissue are conveyed to the brain. There's a crosstalk there.\",\n",

For instance, that cold water immersion is more likely to positively influence muscular power performance, to reduce muscle soreness, to reduce serum creatine kinase, and to improve perceived recovery after high intensity exercise as compared with passive recovery. This can be translated to cold water exposure after training is beneficial and probably better than passive recovery from a number of standpoints. In addition, they say that dose response relationships, meaning the amount and the degree of cold that people were exposed to and how often they did that, in particular in lower temperature cold immersion. So these would be the sorts of cold immersion protocols that are one minute or two minutes, three minutes, maybe five minutes, but that one couldn't stay in there longer because it feels stressful and one wants to get out, may be more effective after high intensity exercise for removal of serum creatine kinase, as well that these shorter duration cold water immersion approaches may be more effective after high intensity endurance performance as well.\",\n",

It's not quite hitting failure, but you're really pushing the system to the point where you are not ready to do another set and yet you begin another set. You're not necessarily psychologically ready. I'll talk more about some of the adaptations that this causes in terms of stroke volume in a few minutes when we talk about how it is that work of this sort can increase our heart's ability to deliver blood and oxygen to our lungs and other tissues. I'm going to get very specific about how to breathe during these different types of protocols and what's happening at the level of the heart. But I want to make sure I touch on the fourth protocol, which is high-intensity aerobic conditioning. So HIT has these two forms, anaerobic and aerobic, and you just heard about anaerobic. High-intensity aerobic conditioning also involves about three to 12 sets, starting off, of course, with fewer sets as you're getting into this training, and then extending into more sets as one parameter you could expand.\",\n",

I also talked about just sort of performance adaptations, how doing high intensity aerobic conditioning of the mile repeats type training can actually improve your ability to do long bouts of intense work. It also seems like it dovetails or is compatible with resistance training that's aimed towards strength and hypertrophy. Now in full disclosure, the data seemed to indicate that if people just weight train or train for strength, so three reps, rest five minutes, three reps of heavy weights, et cetera, yeah, you'll get much stronger than you would if you're doing things like, you know, five repetitions up to 12 or 12 to 25 reps and you're, you know, and you're going out for long jogs.

Today's discussion was a particularly meaningful one because not only is Tim a pioneer in the world of podcasting, but it also marked the nine-year anniversary of his podcast, The Tim Ferriss Show. Now, as I mentioned earlier, Tim is known for being able to see around corners or predict the future. He really does seem to be about five, if not 10 years ahead of everybody else in thinking about tools for optimization in particular domains of life. And so we were very fortunate that during today's discussion, he shares with us his current creative endeavors and how he's thinking about and approaching those. And he also breaks down for us the process of how to think about and prioritize one's schedule, not just on the order of the day, not just on the order of the week, but really thinking about one's life as a journey and how to organize and go about that journey.\",\n",

Tim Ferriss is also dedicated to various philanthropic efforts, the most recent of which is the donation of several millions of his own dollars to research on psychedelics for the treatment of otherwise intractable psychiatric challenges, such as major depression, suicidal depression, eating disorders, and addiction. And he's also brought together other philanthropists, which has really galvanized the whole field of psychedelic research for the treatment of mental health, transforming it from what was recently kind of a fringe area of science to a mainstay that's actually funded not only by philanthropy, but by the National Institutes of Health.\",\n",

These incidentally, another example of where Ferris was early to the game and the rest of us are kind of just in his wake. He talked about the use of blood glucose monitors. Those I think at the time were implanted below the skin. Nowadays, they're less invasive blood glucose monitors, things like levels and so forth. And these are actually becoming pretty popular. I've worn one of these before. They're actually pretty informative. I learned for instance, that when I go in the sauna, that I experience a sharp rise in blood glucose.

I would encourage you to explore some of the protocols that Dr. Andy Galpin and I discussed on the exercise series that we did with Dr. Galpin. That would be largely training after a warmup, of course, in the one to three repetition range. And even some training that's done strictly for power, moving the weight quickly at loads that are substantially lighter. Although for some people, just because of their genetic makeup, they are going to react with hypertrophy to that kind of training. So I would say if you want to weight train, which is a great idea, and you don't want to put on size, but you want to get stronger, train in that one to three repetition range. Now that does not necessarily mean one repetition maximums, you know, eking out the absolute last single rep that you can with the most amount of weight. Maybe you back off on your single repetition maximum, you're still just doing one repetition.\",\n",

       "    'answer': \"You still need to dim the lights in the evening, but there's a very nice study that was published in Scientific Reports that illustrates that if one does this, if you go outside and view sunlight in the evening hours for anywhere from five to 30 minutes, and I realize that people have a range of constraints on their schedule, but from five to 30 minutes, what happens is that your melatonin rhythm stays appropriate. Now, we haven't talked too much about melatonin, but melatonin is a hormone that is inhibited by light. It's actually prevented by light. And melatonin is the hormone that allows you to fall asleep easily. Now I'm not talking about supplementing melatonin. I'm talking about melatonin that you naturally produce from your pineal. So the protocol is very simple. Get outside in the afternoon or evening for 10 to 30 minutes, take your sunglasses off, get some bright light, get some natural light in your eyes. If you can't do that, probably better to just stay with standard artificial lights inside. Don't crank them up, but just start to dim them. Again, this would be a time to avoid blue blockers.\",\n",

Now melatonin, a lot of people think of as a supplement, but melatonin is naturally released as the evening comes about and into the nighttime hours, it's a hormone that makes you feel sleepy and allows you to fall asleep. So viewing bright light in the late evening hours and nighttime hours is really not good for your sleep quality and your ability to fall and stay asleep. So for most people, a simple rule of thumb is going to be avoid bright artificial lights of all colors. And in particular overhead, bright artificial lights between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. That's right, between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m., avoid those bright artificial lights as much as possible. Use only as much light as is absolutely necessary in order to carry out the routines and activities you need to carry out safely.\",\n",

       "     {'content': \"If you can't get sunlight for whatever reason, you want to use bright artificial light, but that is absolutely critical for timing the cortisol release properly, limiting cortisol release to the early part of the day, getting increases in dopamine that are going to promote the production of testosterone and estrogen to healthy levels. The other aspect of light viewing behavior that's extremely important is to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes in the middle of the night. If you're viewing bright light in the middle of the night, you are suppressing dopamine release. If you're suppressing dopamine release, you are suppressing testosterone levels. So much so that I would wager that a major effect of sleep deprivation on reducing testosterone and estrogen is not necessarily because of the lack of sleep per se. It's because usually when people are not getting enough sleep, they're getting too much light in their eyes in the middle of the night as well. A study on this has not been completed yet, but there are two studies published in Cell and Neuron, both Cell Press journals, excellent journals, showing that viewing bright light with the eyes in the middle of the circadian night has a detrimental effect on dopamine and therefore has a detrimental effect on things like testosterone and estrogen.\",\n",

Even though we are asleep, disrupting the way that our cardiometabolic function operates such that we have lower heart rate variability and increased insulin resistance. This is not a good thing for any of us to experience. So while we've mainly been talking about the positive effects of UVB light and other forms of light, now we have two examples, one from the work of Hattar and Kali showing that UVB exposure via the perihabenula can diminish the output of dopamine and other molecules that make us feel good if that UVB exposure is in the middle of the night or late evening.\",\n",

In fact, we talked about this in the episode on hormones, about how getting light onto as much of our skin as we can throughout the day can really help in the production of testosterone and estrogen in both men and women in healthy ways that improves mood and libido and all sorts of things that are associated with wellbeing. However, because light is such a powerful stimulus for controlling the timing of your sleepfulness or sleepiness, I should say, and wakefulness, we might want to be cautious about how much light we are viewing in the afternoon, in particular in the early evening hours, right? Well, turns out it's not so straightforward. Viewing, so sunlight to the eyes, sunlight in the late afternoon and evening hours.\",\n",

So this UK biobank is an incredibly valuable resource. And there are now multiple studies establishing that one's pattern of light exposure is extremely important. Now, the previous study in 400,000 participants basically nailed home the idea that the more time you spend outdoors, the better is your mood, the better is your sleep, the better is the rhythmicity of your sleep-wake cycles and on and on.
